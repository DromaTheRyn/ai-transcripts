When nothing really excites you anymore? The things you used to enjoy, the life you once dreamed of, it all feels hollow. And it&#x27;s not like you&#x27;re sad or depressed. It&#x27;s more like an indifference. Like nothing really seems to matter. You go through the motions, but something always seems to be missing.</a><a name="ts_26470_38230_S00" > In this video, I want to explore with you how we get into this state, but more importantly, how we can get out of it. Because I can assure you that most of us are looking in the wrong place.</a><a name="ts_38630_57160_S00" > A while ago, I found myself in this state too. After a year of big life events, life lessons and even more emotional turmoil, I was left with an emptiness. I thought about the life that I once dreamed of and the things that would light a spark in me.</a><a name="ts_57740_78210_S00" > And I felt nothing. No future I could think of felt exciting. Everything felt like a have to instead of a want to. I felt like I was constantly dragging myself through the day. Because I didn&#x27;t feel motivation for anything.</a><a name="ts_78210_89632_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:18]</span> So desperate for an answer as to how to get out of this state, I dove into my thoughts, hoping that I could find the solution there.</a><a name="ts_90496_102528_S00" > I thought about my life&#x27;s purpose, my mission. What is the meaning of my life? Because maybe I was just doing the wrong things. And if I could find the right things, I get my spark back again.</a><a name="ts_102528_104064_S00" > (..)</a><a name="ts_104064_115200_S00" > So I dissected my inner world like it was a puzzle. Like there was a missing piece of information somewhere that would magically unlock my excitement and my motivation again.</a><a name="ts_116192_127310_S00" > For months, I thought about it. And after I couldn&#x27;t find the answer internally, I started searching externally. In books, theory, spirituality, philosophy.</a><a name="ts_127310_137170_S00" > I thought that if I just kept thinking harder, analyzing more, find the right book, find the right theory, I&#x27;d find the missing piece of information.</a><a name="ts_137950_144350_S00" > But the harder I thought, the emptier I felt. And that&#x27;s when I began to realize something.</a><a name="ts_144350_158112_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:24]</span> You cannot think your way out of a feeling problem. When life feels empty and meaningless, it&#x27;s not because it is. It&#x27;s because our emotional connection to it is gone.</a><a name="ts_158112_160096_S00" > (..)</a><a name="ts_160096_166770_S00" > Life is like an empty coloring page.
