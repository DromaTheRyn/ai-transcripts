if you have a set of guidelines, if you have a set of values, if you have what they call panic rules,</a><a name="ts_20860_24660_S00" > things that you do when things feel like they&#x27;re falling

name="ts_127730_131090_S00" > He says, we should ask ourselves at every moment, is this thing essential?</a><a name="ts_131270_133030_S00" > And he says, if it isn&#x27;t, we should get rid of it.</a><a name="ts_133090_135210_S00" > And by the way, much of what we do is not essential.</a><a name="ts_135330_136010_S00" > It&#x27;s not important.</a><a name="ts_136030_136970_S00" > It&#x27;s

glittering distraction that caught our attention.</a><a name="ts_143230_145250_S00" > It&#x27;s something that doesn&#x27;t move the needle.</a><a name="ts_145430_149690_S00" > And he says, when you get rid of the inessential, you get this double benefit.</a><a name="ts_149690_152130_S00" > He says, because then you can do the essential things better.</a><a name="ts_152310_156330_S00" > So going into the year, you want to stop wasting your energy, wasting your time,</a><a name="ts_156610_158190_S00" > wasting your mental bandwidth.</a><a name="ts_158390_159650_S00" > You only have so much energy.</a><a name="ts_159650_161170_S00" > You only have so much time.</a><a name="ts_161350_163030_S00" > Focus it on the essential things.</a><a name="ts_163210_165090_S00" > Look, the morning is calm.</a><a name="ts_165090_167050_S00" > The morning is quiet.</a><a name="ts_167270_168170_S00" > Less has happened.</a><a name="ts_168510_169770_S00" > Less is asked of you.</a><a name="ts_169770_173550_S00" > And most people sleep through this golden, wonderful time.</a><a name="ts_173550_176770_S00" > The morning is the most important time of the day.</a><a name="ts_176770_178950_S00" > I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s easy to get up early.</a><a name="ts_179090_183570_S00" > One of the fascinating passages in meditations as Mark&#x27;s really arguing with himself about</a><a name="ts_183570_184530_S00" > why he should get up early.</a><a name="ts_184630_188510_S00" > He says, you were not put here to huddle under the covers and stay warm.</a><a name="ts_188510_191750_S00" > The morning is a sacred, special, wonderful time.</a><a name="ts_192010_194250_S00" > Wake up, get after it.</a><a name="ts_194390_198250_S00" > You were not meant to huddle under the covers and be warm.</a><a name="ts_198630_200150_S00" > Take this quiet time.</a><a name="ts_200290_202550_S00" > Don&#x27;t get sucked into your phone right away.</a><a name="ts_202830_203550_S00" > Use it.</a><a name="ts_203670_208730_S00" > And if you&#x27;re getting up early, then number five bookends very nicely with that.</a><a name="ts_208850_214310_S00" > At the end of the day, take some time to reflect on the time just passed through journaling.</a><a name="ts_214310_216690_S00" > This is basically what stoicism is.</a><a name="ts_216790_220590_S00" > I would say stoicism and journaling are inseparable practices.</a><a name="ts_220910_225890_S00" > And given how crazy, given how frustrating, given how overwhelming the year is likely to be,</a><a name="ts_226250_229190_S00" > where and how are you going to be processing that?</a><a name="ts_229370_232350_S00" > Where and how are you going to be holding yourself accountable?</a><a name="ts_232770_236450_S00" > Seneca says we should basically interrogate ourselves at the end of the day.</a><a name="ts_236550_238890_S00" > He said he waited for his wife to go to sleep and he would sit down</a><a name="ts_238890_242650_S00" > and sit with the pages of a journal and look at what he did well.</a><a name="ts_242650_244170_S00" > Look at what he didn&#x27;t do so well.</a><a name="ts_244290_246890_S00" > He said, let nothing pass you by.</a><a name="ts_247250_248230_S00" > Put it up for review.</a><a name="ts_248430_252270_S00" > The evening review is the perfect way to wind down the day.</a><a name="ts_252590_255030_S00" > Go to sleep and wake up and do better tomorrow.</a><a name="ts_255430_257650_S00" > Stop giving your time away.</a><a name="ts_257910_263570_S00" > It&#x27;s crazy, the stoics say, that we are protective of our property and of our money.</a><a name="ts_263710_265410_S00" > And then we&#x27;re frivolous with our time.</a><a name="ts_265530_267710_S00" > The one thing you can&#x27;t recover.</a><a name="ts_267910_271340_S00" > The one thing they&#x27;re not making any more of.</a><a name="ts_271340_273020_S00" > Life isn&#x27;t short, Seneca says.</a><a name="ts_273120_274848_S00" > A year is a long time.</a><a name="ts_275520_275750_S00" > Problem?</a><a name="ts_275990_277150_S00" > We just waste it.</a><a name="ts_277250_279150_S00" > We waste it on inessential things.</a><a name="ts_279310_284090_S00" > We waste it getting distracted and upset by things that have nothing to do with us,</a><a name="ts_284170_285270_S00" > that we can&#x27;t control.</a><a name="ts_285510_286610_S00" > Time is precious.</a><a name="ts_287210_288570_S00" > Act accordingly.</a><a name="ts_288810_291110_S00" > You only have so many hours in a day.</a><a name="ts_291230_292990_S00" > You only have so many hours in a year.</a><a name="ts_293150_294870_S00" > How are you going to spend them?</a><a name="ts_294990_297150_S00" > And how are you going to spend them on things that matter?</a><a name="ts_297490_299710_S00" > Always be challenging yourself.</a><a name="ts_299710_304570_S00" > The stoics would say, life is uncomfortable, so get used to being uncomfortable.</a><a name="ts_304830_309630_S00" > Seneca would set aside a certain number of days throughout the year where he would survive</a><a name="ts_309630_312390_S00" > on very little food or sleep on the ground.</a><a name="ts_312530_313930_S00" > He would try to rough it, basically.</a><a name="ts_314130_318990_S00" > And he said the point of this was to get up close and comfortable with conditions that you</a><a name="ts_318990_321750_S00" > can then say to yourself, this is what I was afraid of.</a><a name="ts_321850_324590_S00" > Most of the time we&#x27;re trying to make life easier and smoother.</a><a name="ts_324770_326310_S00" > That&#x27;s a good instinct, I guess.</a><a name="ts_326310_330510_S00" > But the problem then is that this makes us afraid of losing that comfort.</a><a name="ts_330670_334750_S00" > And if we can actively challenge ourselves, get outside our comfort zone, get familiar</a><a name="ts_334750_338990_S00" > with other states of living and being that other people are petrified of, it makes us</a><a name="ts_338990_340990_S00" > freer because then we can be more courageous.</a><a name="ts_341010_343670_S00" > We understand we can handle whatever happens.</a><a name="ts_343670_345790_S00" > And we&#x27;re toughening ourselves up as we go.</a><a name="ts_345870_346750_S00" > And that&#x27;s always a good thing.</a><a name="ts_346870_350950_S00" > You should do something for the common good every single day, right?</a><a name="ts_351070_351970_S00" > The world is dark.</a><a name="ts_351970_354570_S00" > Bad things are going to be happening in 2026.</a><a name="ts_354910_357550_S00" > Things you don&#x27;t like are going to happen in 2026.</a><a name="ts_357770_362050_S00" > If you want to make sure you don&#x27;t live in a dark, screwed up, awful world, well, one</a><a name="ts_362050_364390_S00" > thing you can do is not be dark and awful.</a><a name="ts_364530_365770_S00" > You can do good things, right?</a><a name="ts_365870_367750_S00" > Stoicism is not just about self-improvement.</a><a name="ts_367870_371330_S00" > It&#x27;s a philosophy around helping others and improving the world.</a><a name="ts_371470_375550_S00" > Mark Spiegel talks about the idea of the common good something like 80 times in meditations.</a><a name="ts_375690_376210_S00" > He says actually,</a><a name="ts_376210_380850_S00" > The fruit of a good life is good character and acts for the common good.</a><a name="ts_381010_382450_S00" > So what is the good you&#x27;re going to do?</a><a name="ts_382550_386030_S00" > And if you can set a rule that you always try to do good, you&#x27;ll have a good year.</a><a name="ts_386330_388250_S00" > Number nine, silence distractions.</a><a name="ts_388550_391610_S00" > Here at the beginning of the year, get a TV out of your bedroom.</a><a name="ts_392070_393850_S00" > Get the phone out of your bedroom.</a><a name="ts_394290_395970_S00" > Delete apps from your phone.</a><a name="ts_396290_397470_S00" > Limit the inputs.</a><a name="ts_397730_401250_S00" > We are needlessly bombarded by way too much noise.</a><a name="ts_401550_403550_S00" > Way too many things competing for our attention.</a><a name="ts_403710_405730_S00" > And you got to learn how to shut this out.</a><a name="ts_405730_408550_S00" > Stoics talk about concentrating like a Roman.</a><a name="ts_408750_412150_S00" > Doing it as if this thing in front of you matters.</a><a name="ts_412430_415010_S00" > Being philosophical is the ability to go deep.</a><a name="ts_415230_416890_S00" > It&#x27;s the ability to lock in.</a><a name="ts_417110_418870_S00" > The ability to tune out.</a><a name="ts_419210_421650_S00" > And you&#x27;re going to need this in a crazy year.</a><a name="ts_421930_424690_S00" > Ten, pause before you react.</a><a name="ts_424890_429090_S00" > Athena Doris, an ancient Stoic who lived in the time of Augustus.</a><a name="ts_429130_433190_S00" > He&#x27;s an advisor to the future young emperor back when his name was Octavian.</a><a name="ts_433190_437850_S00" > And he tells Octavian that one of the keys to being a successful leader is that before</a><a name="ts_437850_443830_S00" > he reacts to anything, before he does anything out of anger, he should count all 24 letters</a><a name="ts_443830_444990_S00" > of the alphabet.</a><a name="ts_445110_447450_S00" > There are only being 24 letters in the alphabet then.</a><a name="ts_447610_449810_S00" > The idea is pause and reflect.</a><a name="ts_450070_451270_S00" > You can have the emotion.</a><a name="ts_451290_452290_S00" > You can have the feeling.</a><a name="ts_452410_453050_S00" > You can be triggered.</a><a name="ts_453050_456850_S00" > But what matters is whether you take the action on it or not.</a><a name="ts_457090_458250_S00" > Pause and reflect.</a><a name="ts_458530_462250_S00" > I actually carry a coin in my pocket that reminds me of this very idea.</a><a name="ts_462350_462770_S00" > It&#x27;s awesome.</a><a name="ts_462930_468110_S00" > One of the things we do when we pause and reflect, we have to put every impression and emotion and</a><a name="ts_468110_469850_S00" > an opinion to the test, right?</a><a name="ts_469970_472870_S00" > This is what Stoicism is saying, I&#x27;m having this feeling.</a><a name="ts_473010_474240_S00" > I&#x27;m having this thought.</a><a name="ts_474816_475470_S00" > Is it true?</a><a name="ts_475650_476570_S00" > Is it important?</a><a name="ts_476570_481790_S00" > Is it in line with the values I have with the person I want to be?</a><a name="ts_481970_486750_S00" > Epictetus talked about how a philosopher should be able to take every impression, opinion,</a><a name="ts_486850_492130_S00" > bit of information it gets and test it the way a money changer checks for counterfeit currency.</a><a name="ts_492130_498090_S00" > He said they can bang it on the table and tell in an instant if the metal is diluted or not.</a><a name="ts_498170_500110_S00" > The idea is you&#x27;re going to have emotions.</a><a name="ts_500130_501370_S00" > You&#x27;re going to have strong opinions.</a><a name="ts_501510_504790_S00" > You&#x27;re going to think things and want to do things in 2026.</a><a name="ts_504790_508570_S00" > But do you have the ability to go, hey, is my assumption here correct?</a><a name="ts_508810_510650_S00" > Is my information correct, right?</a><a name="ts_510690_511950_S00" > Is this what I want to do?</a><a name="ts_512050_513070_S00" > Is this who I want to be?</a><a name="ts_513190_514670_S00" > You want to put all this stuff to the test.</a><a name="ts_514810_516370_S00" > The Stoics were not emotionless.</a><a name="ts_516530_519210_S00" > They just tried not to do things out of emotion.</a><a name="ts_519350_520490_S00" > And that is a critical difference.</a><a name="ts_520670_524590_S00" > If you want to have a rich 2026, reduce your desires.</a><a
