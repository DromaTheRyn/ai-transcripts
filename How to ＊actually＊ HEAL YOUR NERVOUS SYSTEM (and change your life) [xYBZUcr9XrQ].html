I promise you it&#x27;ll be worth it,</a><a name="ts_30870_35890_S00" > because regulating your nervous system is one of those things that will completely change your life.</a><a name="ts_36010_39850_S00" > Hey friend, welcome back. If you&#x27;re new here, my name&#x27;s Jill, and I help women step into their power,</a><a name="ts_39990_43390_S00" > tap into their divine feminine, and become their best self, live their dream life.</a><a name="ts_43430_46770_S00" > So if that&#x27;s something you want to do, you should subscribe and stick around.</a><a name="ts_46890_50070_S00" > And in case you want more from me, you can always check out my Deep Dive Feminine Energy course,</a><a name="ts_50110_53510_S00" > or any of my other courses or digital products. They are always linked down below.</a><a name="ts_53510_56950_S00" > Okay, so before we get into how to actually heal your nervous system,</a><a name="ts_57250_62210_S00" > we need to talk about what the nervous system even is in the first place and why it matters so much.</a><a name="ts_62330_66890_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:02]</span> Because once you understand this, it&#x27;ll become a lot easier to understand how to fix it.</a><a name="ts_67010_71170_S00" > So your nervous system is basically the communication system of your entire body.</a><a name="ts_71310_76110_S00" > It&#x27;s a network made up of your brain, your spinal cord, and all of the nerves that run throughout your body.</a><a name="ts_76110_78130_S00" > And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s called your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_78130_84170_S00" > And it has one main job, to constantly scan what&#x27;s happening, both inside your body and around you,</a><a name="ts_84250_85610_S00" > and decide how to respond.</a><a name="ts_85810_88450_S00" > It&#x27;s basically your body&#x27;s internal control center.</a><a name="ts_88450_91510_S00" > So it decides, should you relax or be on high alert?</a><a name="ts_91670_93410_S00" > Should your heart slow down or speed up?</a><a name="ts_93470_95070_S00" > Is this moment safe or threatening?</a><a name="ts_95270_97610_S00" > It&#x27;s constantly scanning, trying to figure it out.</a><a name="ts_97770_100470_S00" > It&#x27;s constantly scanning for danger and threats.</a><a name="ts_100470_103470_S00" > And it&#x27;s very good at its job, sometimes too good.</a><a name="ts_103470_107290_S00" > And so your nervous system has two major gears that it switches between.</a><a name="ts_107430_110310_S00" > Fight or flight mode, aka your sympathetic nervous system.</a><a name="ts_110450_111670_S00" > This is your stress mode.</a><a name="ts_111770_113770_S00" > This is your body-sensing danger mode.</a><a name="ts_113850_117730_S00" > And then there&#x27;s the rest and digest mode, aka the parasympathetic nervous system.</a><a name="ts_117850_119810_S00" > This is your calm, happy healing mode.</a><a name="ts_119930_123410_S00" > This helps you feel safe and connected and grounded and able to fully relax.</a><a name="ts_123630_128750_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:03]</span> But if your nervous system is stuck in stress mode all the time, which for a lot of people it is,</a><a name="ts_128750_134590_S00" > that means that your body is chronically sensing danger, even when none actually exists.</a><a name="ts_134750_136750_S00" > And when this happens, your hormones get thrown off.</a><a name="ts_136830_138010_S00" > Your digestion gets thrown off.</a><a name="ts_138070_140410_S00" > You feel anxious, exhausted, or emotionally reactive.</a><a name="ts_140430_142370_S00" > You struggle to sleep or feel calm.</a><a name="ts_142490_144550_S00" > You constantly overthink or people-please.</a><a name="ts_144690_147050_S00" > You might even self-sabotage or get sick more easily.</a><a name="ts_147170_148210_S00" > It affects everything.</a><a name="ts_148210_151370_S00" > Your physical health, your mental health, your emotions, your relationships,</a><a name="ts_151370_155010_S00" > your ability to make decisions, your ability to trust yourself, everything.</a><a name="ts_155250_158610_S00" > So healing your nervous system isn&#x27;t just about being a little less anxious.</a><a name="ts_158750_162730_S00" > It&#x27;s about helping your body feel safe again so it can function properly.</a><a name="ts_162790_167330_S00" > And so you can show up as your full, grounded, confident magnetic self.</a><a name="ts_167490_171330_S00" > Now here&#x27;s the part that changes everything and what most people don&#x27;t understand.</a><a name="ts_171530_174530_S00" > Your nervous system doesn&#x27;t just react to real danger.</a><a name="ts_174750_176850_S00" > You want it to react to danger.</a><a name="ts_176990_181210_S00" > If you&#x27;re taking a nice little walk and you see a tiger, you want your body to freak out.</a><a name="ts_181370_183370_S00" > You want all the alarm bells to go off.</a><a name="ts_183430_187070_S00" > You&#x27;re supposed to have a strong sense of danger because that&#x27;s what keeps you alive.</a><a name="ts_187070_190310_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:07]</span> But your nervous system is not just reacting to danger.</a><a name="ts_190590_193790_S00" > It&#x27;s reacting to perceived danger.</a><a name="ts_194190_195850_S00" > And that is a huge difference.</a><a name="ts_196130_196690_S00" > It&#x27;s like this.</a><a name="ts_196750_201670_S00" > If you&#x27;re out on that same walk and you see a big four-legged animal running through the trees,</a><a name="ts_201790_205750_S00" > your body immediately thinks, ah, tiger, and turns on stress mode.</a><a name="ts_205890_209890_S00" > When in reality, it was actually just a fluffy golden retriever.</a><a name="ts_209890_211030_S00" > There is no real threat.</a><a name="ts_211030_212130_S00" > There is no real danger.</a><a name="ts_212270_213730_S00" > But you&#x27;re reacting like there is.</a><a name="ts_213830_218030_S00" > You are still having the same exact experience as if there was a tiger.</a><a name="ts_218170_222070_S00" > Because that&#x27;s what your nervous system is anticipating and perceiving.</a><a name="ts_222250_223850_S00" > It&#x27;s not responding to what&#x27;s true.</a><a name="ts_224150_226890_S00" > It&#x27;s responding to what it anticipates.</a><a name="ts_227090_233890_S00" > The root cause of a chronically dysregulated nervous system is perceived or anticipated danger.</a><a name="ts_234630_236950_S00" > Constant perceived or anticipated danger.</a><a name="ts_236950_239730_S00" > Not from real, actual, immediate threats.</a><a name="ts_239970_241030_S00" > Okay, so this is important.</a><a name="ts_241030_246450_S00" > If you have a dysregulated nervous system and you struggle to stay calm and grounded,</a><a name="ts_247360_250590_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:07]</span> why is your body perceiving and anticipating danger?</a><a name="ts_250770_252430_S00" > That is the question you need to ask yourself.</a><a name="ts_252450_257310_S00" > Why is my body constantly perceiving and anticipating danger so much?</a><a name="ts_257370_258910_S00" > And sometimes you won&#x27;t consciously know.</a><a name="ts_259050_259650_S00" > And that&#x27;s fine.</a><a name="ts_259910_262930_S00" > This is very often an unconscious, deep-in-your-body thing.</a><a name="ts_262930_268210_S00" > So you may not know exactly why, but your body and your subconscious mind remember everything.</a><a name="ts_268370_270370_S00" > Even when your conscious mind doesn&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_270490_273610_S00" > But what you need to realize is that this isn&#x27;t just some personality flaw.</a><a name="ts_273830_277130_S00" > A dysregulated nervous system is a survival adaptation.</a><a name="ts_277470_277970_S00" > Think about it.</a><a name="ts_278050_282450_S00" > If you grew up in a house where you had to constantly read the room to stay safe,</a><a name="ts_282950_285650_S00" > your body learned to pick up on the tiniest signals.</a><a name="ts_285790_287870_S00" > If you experienced rejection or abandonment,</a><a name="ts_288010_290110_S00" > your system learned that being alone equals danger.</a><a name="ts_290110_292710_S00" > If there was a lot of financial stress or instability,</a><a name="ts_293030_296350_S00" > your nervous system tagged money as a threat.</a><a name="ts_296670_300790_S00" > Some things happened that caused your nervous system to become heightened,</a><a name="ts_301030_304670_S00" > to become ultra-sensitive and ultra-reactive to threats.</a><a name="ts_304670_307750_S00" > So that same body and that system that kept you safe at one point</a><a name="ts_307750_310030_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:07]</span> is actually just causing you havoc now.</a><a name="ts_310030_315450_S00" > And it&#x27;s what&#x27;s causing you to always stay overwhelmed and stressed and anxious and shut down.</a><a name="ts_315610_317330_S00" > That weird tone in your boss&#x27;s email.</a><a name="ts_317450_318470_S00" > Your credit card balance.</a><a name="ts_318470_321310_S00" > Or when you text that guy you like and he doesn&#x27;t respond.</a><a name="ts_321490_322550_S00" > All potential danger.</a><a name="ts_322750_325910_S00" > Especially to a nervous system that adapted to become sensitive.</a><a name="ts_326090_329850_S00" > The problem isn&#x27;t that you feel anxious about money or you overthink or you people-please.</a><a name="ts_330010_331790_S00" > There&#x27;s a deeper thing going on here.</a><a name="ts_331910_333730_S00" > The problem is that somewhere along the way,</a><a name="ts_333850_335410_S00" > your system decided,</a><a name="ts_335870_336850_S00" > it concluded,</a><a name="ts_337390_341710_S00" > that those normal parts of life are threats to your survival.</a><a name="ts_341850_343670_S00" > So your nervous system is stuck asking,</a><a name="ts_343670_344270_S00" > am I safe?</a><a name="ts_344370_344850_S00" > Am I safe?</a><a name="ts_344930_345330_S00" > Am I good?</a><a name="ts_345450_345930_S00" > Am I safe?</a><a name="ts_346050_346490_S00" > Am I safe?</a><a name="ts_346590_347170_S00" > Am I good?</a><a name="ts_347290_348790_S00" > And the answer it keeps getting is,</a><a name="ts_348870_349150_S00" > no.</a><a name="ts_349330_349690_S00" > Scary.</a><a name="ts_349890_350210_S00" > Danger.</a><a name="ts_350410_350650_S00" > Nope.</a><a name="ts_350810_351170_S00" > Watch out.</a><a name="ts_351290_352210_S00" > Don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s good enough.</a><a name="ts_352290_353950_S00" > Eh, not really sure about that one.</a><a name="ts_354110_354990_S00" > Definitely not safe.</a><a name="ts_355030_358170_S00" > The point that I want to drive into your brain right now</a><a name="ts_358170_361630_S00" > is that your nervous system became ultra sensitive</a><a name="ts_361630_365110_S00" > because it thinks there&#x27;s some perceived danger lurking around.</a><a name="ts_365370_369750_S00" > And really at the core of all of this is a lack of trust.</a><a name="ts_369930_373810_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:09]</span> And that is what I&#x27;ve never heard anybody say when it comes to the nervous system.</a><a name="ts_373970_374770_S00" > Underneath it all,</a><a name="ts_374970_378090_S00" > nervous system dysregulation is about broken trust.</a><a name="ts_378250_379110_S00" > Trust with yourself.</a><a name="ts_379370_380130_S00" > Trust with others.</a><a name="ts_380450_381330_S00" > Trust with life.</a><a name="ts_381610_382510_S00" > Trust with uncertainty.</a><a name="ts_382790_384710_S00" > Your system doesn&#x27;t trust that you can handle stress</a><a name="ts_384710_387750_S00" > and your system doesn&#x27;t trust that you can handle whatever comes your way.</a><a name="ts_387750_389910_S00" > And so that is what we have to fix.</a><a name="ts_390090_392030_S00" > To truly regulate and heal your nervous system,</a><a name="ts_392170_394910_S00" > you have to convince your brain and your body that you are safe now</a><a name="ts_394910_396530_S00" > over and over again</a><a name="ts_396530_399690_S00" > so that your system stops seeing life as a constant threat.</a><a name="ts_399830_401350_S00" > And we&#x27;re going to talk about how to do this,</a><a name="ts_401390_405470_S00" > but just know this isn&#x27;t about trying to eliminate all discomfort from your life.</a><a name="ts_405590_408010_S00" > This is about expanding your capacity to handle it</a><a name="ts_408010_410490_S00" > without immediately jumping into survival mode.</a><a name="ts_410570_413030_S00" > Because once your brain and your body start to feel safe,</a><a name="ts_413270_415290_S00" > once you learn to trust life again,</a><a name="ts_415490_417610_S00" > stress will still be an inconvenience.</a><a name="ts_417750_420130_S00" > discomfort will still be uncomfortable,</a><a name="ts_420130_422410_S00" > but it won&#x27;t feel like danger anymore.</a><a name="ts_422450_424370_S00" > And that&#x27;s what we have to separate.</a><a name="ts_424530_426330_S00" > It won&#x27;t trigger a full survival response</a><a name="ts_426330_428950_S00" > because
