I promise it&#x27;s relevant.</a><a name="ts_25080_29380_S00" > Okay, so last year Ryan and I bought a new couch for the first time in our lives.</a><a name="ts_29380_36870_S00" > So previous to that, we&#x27;ve always bought couches used from the classifieds and we just took our chances.</a><a name="ts_37230_41690_S00" > But I guess now that we&#x27;re like 40, we should buy a new, we thought we should buy a new couch.</a><a name="ts_41770_47050_S00" > So we picked out a couch from Costco and we rented a truck and we drove it home.</a><a name="ts_47290_50010_S00" > And then we had to figure out how to get it into our house.</a><a name="ts_50170_53370_S00" > It was like 300 pounds, maybe it was more than that.</a><a name="ts_53610_57430_S00" > And it was in this huge box, like four feet by like seven feet.</a><a name="ts_57430_62130_S00" > And the box had handles and between the two of us, we could like barely lift it.</a><a name="ts_62310_66970_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:02]</span> So we tried to get it in through the door from the garage, but that door was too narrow.</a><a name="ts_67250_71190_S00" > So then we tried to get it through the front door and that door was wider and it fit.</a><a name="ts_71670_76290_S00" > But then our hallway turns 90 degrees and we couldn&#x27;t get it through the turn.</a><a name="ts_76290_77270_S00" > Remind you of anything?</a><a name="ts_77270_78350_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_78350_82780_S00" > Yeah, so it did not feel like a sitcom in the moment.</a><a name="ts_83140_90040_S00" > So we&#x27;re like sweating, I have a migraine, and we are like heaving this enormous box all over the place</a><a name="ts_90040_91940_S00" > and trying to like twist it and turn it.</a><a name="ts_92040_96200_S00" > And okay, I promise this has something to do with feeling like you&#x27;re never good enough.</a><a name="ts_96200_101900_S00" > Okay, so then we try flipping it like vertical to try to get it around that turn.</a><a name="ts_102200_107860_S00" > And all this time, we just keep it in this huge box because it has these handles.</a><a name="ts_107920_112300_S00" > And we&#x27;re afraid that if we take it out of the box, we won&#x27;t have anything firm to grip,</a><a name="ts_112340_114540_S00" > just like the slippery edge of couches.</a><a name="ts_114740_117000_S00" > So finally, we give up.</a><a name="ts_117180_118480_S00" > I was exhausted.</a><a name="ts_118840_120160_S00" > Ryan was frustrated.</a><a name="ts_120160_121880_S00" > We may have argued a little bit.</a><a name="ts_122000_124740_S00" > And we talked about just taking the dumb thing back to Costco.</a><a name="ts_124740_128700_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:04]</span> So finally, I say like, gosh, let&#x27;s just take it out of the box.</a><a name="ts_128860_131296_S00" > So we open up the box and lo and behold,</a><a name="ts_131840_136510_S00" > freaking couch is literally in six pieces that click together.</a><a name="ts_136810_138570_S00" > And they&#x27;re like 20 pounds each.</a><a name="ts_138730_138970_S00" > I don&#x27;t know.</a><a name="ts_139090_140470_S00" > They&#x27;re easy to carry individually.</a><a name="ts_140790_143930_S00" > Like once we unpacked it, it was pretty easy to manage.</a><a name="ts_144130_147090_S00" > So feeling never good enough is so big.</a><a name="ts_147370_148210_S00" > It&#x27;s so heavy.</a><a name="ts_148410_149230_S00" > It&#x27;s so scary.</a><a name="ts_149410_151270_S00" > And no one taught us what to do with these thoughts.</a><a name="ts_151330_153670_S00" > And we&#x27;re kind of afraid to take them out of the box</a><a name="ts_153670_156110_S00" > because maybe we won&#x27;t be able to handle them.</a><a name="ts_156230_160330_S00" > But the truth is, when we open them up, when we break them down into small pieces,</a><a name="ts_160330_162550_S00" > we can like work through them.</a><a name="ts_162790_165230_S00" > Like with support, we can totally handle them.</a><a name="ts_165370_168790_S00" > So when we do this kind of work in therapy, a lot of times I hear people say,</a><a name="ts_168990_170610_S00" > man, why didn&#x27;t I do this sooner?</a><a name="ts_170650_172032_S00" > It wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought.</a><a name="ts_172672_176830_S00" > So today, let&#x27;s do this with the belief that you&#x27;re never good enough.</a><a name="ts_176830_181632_S00" > And maybe we can keep you from getting a migraine and sweating profusely.</a><a name="ts_181632_184896_S00" > (...)</a><a name="ts_184896_181632_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:04]</span> Okay.</a><a name="ts_181632_185270_S00" > (....)</a><a name="ts_185270_189170_S00" > So to deal with this harmful belief, we have to start by getting specific.</a><a name="ts_189550_191290_S00" > Never good enough for what?</a><a name="ts_191490_194530_S00" > If you don&#x27;t clarify what this imaginary finish line is,</a><a name="ts_194610_196030_S00" > you&#x27;ll probably feel like you&#x27;re never reaching it.</a><a name="ts_196170_196490_S00" > All right.</a><a name="ts_196630_198270_S00" > So let&#x27;s break down the first one.</a><a name="ts_198630_200480_S00" > Other people are better than me.</a><a name="ts_200480_202368_S00" > (..)</a><a name="ts_202368_205560_S00" > Like everyone else seems happy, but I&#x27;m not.</a><a name="ts_205740_208160_S00" > And you&#x27;re basing your worth on comparison.</a><a name="ts_208160_212440_S00" > So compared to other people, I&#x27;m not rich enough, happy enough, well-traveled enough.</a><a name="ts_212440_217580_S00" > I will never be better than all the people at all the things.</a><a name="ts_217760_221920_S00" > So the internal rules that I&#x27;m following have set me up for a lose-lose.</a><a name="ts_222020_223680_S00" > I can literally never win.</a><a name="ts_223800_224460_S00" > So it&#x27;s true.</a><a name="ts_224560_225860_S00" > Comparison is the thief of joy.</a><a name="ts_225920_228100_S00" > It&#x27;s outsourcing your worth to others.</a><a name="ts_228260_234040_S00" > You decide that other people hold this imaginary ruler to determine if you&#x27;re good enough or not.</a><a name="ts_234260_237180_S00" > Now, there are two modern challenges that make this extra tough,</a><a name="ts_237180_239400_S00" > which is self-improvement media and marketing.</a><a name="ts_239840_242280_S00" > So self-improvement media should be helpful, right?</a><a name="ts_242520_246980_S00" > But honestly, every time I watch a bunch of how to be a better parent videos on Instagram,</a><a name="ts_247320_249620_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:07]</span> I simultaneously learn a bunch of stuff.</a><a name="ts_249700_252680_S00" > And I also start to feel bad about myself as a parent.</a><a name="ts_252860_255020_S00" > Social media shows us others&#x27; facades.</a><a name="ts_255160_261440_S00" > And it&#x27;s easy to believe that we aren&#x27;t good enough in comparison to the 59 seconds that they do let us see.</a><a name="ts_261640_264500_S00" > Okay, the second silent but deadly modern challenge is marketing.</a><a name="ts_264500_267200_S00" > So I&#x27;m talking about advertisements of any kind.</a><a name="ts_267380_273320_S00" > The goal of marketing is to sell products by convincing us that there is something we lack.</a><a name="ts_273580_278840_S00" > Even news and educational listicles send the message that if you only follow these five steps,</a><a name="ts_279120_282740_S00" > then you can be happier, skinnier, faster, richer, stronger, etc.</a><a name="ts_282740_288780_S00" > They basically want to make you feel like that dummy at the beginning of the infomercial who drops everything.</a><a name="ts_289140_291820_S00" > Marketers show us what other people have that we don&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_291940_295280_S00" > Research shows that children who are exposed to more marketing feel unhappier.</a><a name="ts_295400_297420_S00" > And we adults are not immune to this.</a><a name="ts_297560_302160_S00" > So if comparison is the root of feeling never good enough, there are two steps to take.</a><a name="ts_302160_306780_S00" > So first, if you want to survive in this modern world, you have to set limits on your media exposure.</a><a name="ts_307060_310820_S00" > Be very conscious of the effect that marketing has on you.</a><a name="ts_311020_318640_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:11]</span> Overall, it&#x27;s just wise to limit your time on social media and to carefully curate and unfollow content that isn&#x27;t uplifting for you.</a><a name="ts_318880_321860_S00" > Unfortunately, we can&#x27;t throw all the marketing into the ocean.</a><a name="ts_321860_324640_S00" > So you might have to just start with setting some limits on your phone.</a><a name="ts_324640_328380_S00" > And don&#x27;t rely on willpower because we all kind of stink at that.</a><a name="ts_328500_333540_S00" > The Atomic Habits guy had his assistant change the password on his social media at the beginning of the work week</a><a name="ts_333540_335040_S00" > so he could get stuff done.</a><a name="ts_335240_337400_S00" > And I&#x27;ve deleted Instagram off of my phone.</a><a name="ts_337640_338040_S00" > Again.</a><a name="ts_338040_339200_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_339200_339570_S00" > Deleted.</a><a name="ts_339850_344990_S00" > And I actually really like this guy&#x27;s video on how he made his smartphone a dumb phone.</a><a name="ts_345230_346190_S00" > Okay, moving on.</a><a name="ts_346530_349050_S00" > Second, what if we break the comparison ruler?</a><a name="ts_349190_353290_S00" > What if good enough no longer has anything to do with whether other people succeed?</a><a name="ts_353290_357610_S00" > And instead, you get super clear on your own values what you want your life to be about.</a><a name="ts_357830_362410_S00" > I&#x27;ve created a downloadable workbook for you to figure out the kind of life you really care about living.</a><a name="ts_362570_365510_S00" > And then every time you catch yourself comparing yourself to others,</a><a name="ts_365690_369990_S00" > you can shift your attention back to the kind of person that you want to be.</a><a name="ts_370190_374110_S00" > Each day or each week, you can take a moment to reflect and ask yourself,</a><a name="ts_374270_377770_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:14]</span> I value being creative or loving or hardworking.</a><a name="ts_377770_379270_S00" > Did I live that way today?</a><a name="ts_379470_381550_S00" > And then you take action to be that person.</a><a name="ts_381550_383350_S00" > Okay, number two.</a><a name="ts_383650_388950_S00" > The second chunk of feeling like you&#x27;re never good enough is perfectionism.</a><a name="ts_388950_391776_S00" > (...)</a><a name="ts_391776_392530_S00" > It&#x27;s often subtle.</a><a name="ts_392710_394850_S00" > Maybe you don&#x27;t think you&#x27;re a perfectionist,</a><a name="ts_394850_398010_S00" > but let&#x27;s look at some of the sneaky ways that perfectionism shows up.</a><a name="ts_398170_400670_S00" > Maybe you feel like a complete failure if you made a mistake.</a><a name="ts_400670_404550_S00" > You might believe that you need to be flawless in social settings to be approved of.</a><a name="ts_404590_406610_S00" > And by the way, that is not possible.</a><a name="ts_406810_412230_S00" > Or maybe you believe that you should have already figured out most of life&#x27;s problems.</a><a name="ts_412230_413790_S00" > Like, why am I struggling with this?</a><a name="ts_413870_415250_S00" > Other people have it figured out.</a><a name="ts_415410_416870_S00" > Or here&#x27;s another one a lot of people feel.</a><a name="ts_417050_419290_S00" > I&#x27;m just not a good enough blank.</a><a name="ts_419810_421770_S00" > Daughter or son or spouse or parent.</a><a name="ts_421870_425270_S00" > We take our honest desires to show up for others and treat them well, which is good.</a><a name="ts_425370_427390_S00" > But then we take it one step further to,</a><a name="ts_427710_429810_S00" > I must be perfect to be valued.</a><a name="ts_429950_431610_S00" > Otherwise, I&#x27;m not good enough.</a><a name="ts_431770_435010_S00" > It&#x27;s like this idea that like, if I&#x27;m not perfect, I&#x27;m failing as a person.</a><a name="ts_435010_437570_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:15]</span> So, dear perfectionist, please hear me.</a><a name="ts_437770_439570_S00" > This is a belief, not a reality.</a><a name="ts_439710_444730_S00" > It&#x27;s something we construct with words that is oddly comforting, but deeply wounding.</a><a name="ts_444910_445790_S00" > And it&#x27;s not truthful.</a><a name="ts_445930_448550_S00" > It might feel true, but it&#x27;s not helpful in any way.</a><a name="ts_448650_454290_S00" > So, the reality of relationships is that we bring our flaws and our vulnerability to them.</a><a name="ts_454410_457290_S00" > And that creates opportunities to make relationships stronger.</a><a name="ts_457570_462190_S00" > Living together, learning together, and being with other humans necessitates that,</a><a name="ts_462190_466850_S00" > at times, we&#x27;re gonna offend someone, or we&#x27;re gonna miscommunicate, or we&#x27;re gonna make mistakes.</a><a name="ts_467270_473170_S00" > So, interestingly enough, research shows that good enough parenting is actually better for kids</a><a name="ts_473170_475450_S00" > than parents who strive to be perfect.</a><a name="ts_475730_477110_S00" > Like, there is research on this.</a><a name="ts_477230_481410_S00" > Making mistakes and making amends is part of building meaningful relationships.</a><a name="ts_481650_485130_S00" > And we have to accept our flaws as part of progress and connection.</a><a name="ts_485470_490450_S00" > Perfectionism also looks like withdrawing from people and opportunities because we&#x27;re afraid of messing up.</a><a name="ts_490450_496650_S00" > So, I remember one time, like 20 years ago, I was at a primitive skills gathering where experts taught these ancient skills.</a><a name="ts_496810_500870_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:16]</span> And an instructor reached out to me and asked if I wanted to learn pine needle basketry.</a><a name="ts_500950_504630_S00" > And I said no, because I was too embarrassed that I wouldn&#x27;t be good at it.</a><a name="ts_504710_506590_S00" > So, I missed out on that chance to learn.</a><a name="ts_506790_512170_S00" > Like, I can tell that I&#x27;m healthier now because I do stuff a lot more often that I&#x27;m just not good at.</a><a name="ts_512330_515390_S00" > I embrace discomfort, and I&#x27;m learning a bunch of new things.</a><a name="ts_515390_521290_S00" > So, assuming that you want to keep developing as a person, instead of the faulty belief that, like,</a><a name="ts_521410_525910_S00" > I have to be good enough first, and then I can engage, how about instead say,</a><a name="ts_526010_528130_S00" > I will engage as a work in progress.</a><a name="ts_528170_529910_S00" > I&#x27;ll get good at making repairs.</a><a name="ts_530450_535210_S00" > Perfectionism tells you that you&#x27;ve just got to be better and improve yourself, and then you&#x27;ll be good enough.</a><a name="ts_535210_543130_S00" > But a healthier approach is to increase your capacity to be vulnerable, to allow yourself to feel, and to engage, and to mess up,</a><a name="ts_543230_547290_S00" > and then get really good at tolerating discomfort when you show up in a real way.</a><a name="ts_547390_550050_S00" > So, this is a goal that you can actually achieve.</a><a name="ts_550210_552330_S00" > So, with this one, I want you to try a little experiment.</a><a name="ts_552530_556190_S00" > I want you to start questioning these lying little perfectionistic thoughts,</a><a name="ts_556230_560330_S00" > and then go out there and do something that&#x27;s good enough instead of perfect.</a><a name="ts_560330_565670_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:09:20]</span> Bring a gift to a friend that&#x27;s totally adequate instead of presenting it, like, in a perfect way.</a><a name="ts_565970_567950_S00" > Call someone when you don&#x27;t have anything to say.</a><a name="ts_568210_571290_S00" > Ask a girl out on a date that you think you might get rejected by.</a><a name="ts_571470_573490_S00" > Turn in some homework that&#x27;s

yet.</a><a name="ts_600430_604090_S00" > Saying, I&#x27;m not good enough for an Olympic weightlifting gold medal,</a><a name="ts_604110_605170_S00" > that might be true.</a><a

name="ts_611690_613730_S00" > That&#x27;s like saying that an airplane isn&#x27;t good enough</a><a name="ts_613730_618670_S00" > because it&#x27;s still flying towards the destination instead of having already arrived.</a><a name="ts_618670_621810_S00" > There&#x27;s nothing wrong with a plane, it&#x27;s just in the middle of its journey.</a><a name="ts_622010_626350_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:10:22]</span> So, this aspect of feeling never good enough is really about can you tolerate the process,</a><a name="ts_626350_630930_S00" > the journey, of becoming without needing to have arrived.</a><a name="ts_631290_635750_S00" > So, make your good enough about the process, not the end result.</a><a name="ts_635930_640480_S00" > You&#x27;re a person who&#x27;s learning and growing instead of a person who has everything figured out.</a><a name="ts_641152_645850_S00" > It&#x27;s like making sure that your plane is mechanically sound and moving in the right direction</a><a name="ts_645850_650110_S00" > instead of making sure that your plane is staying in the hangar all the time.</a><a name="ts_650330_653050_S00" > Okay, so for example, if you want to run a successful business,</a><a name="ts_653290_655670_S00" > instead of focusing on making a million dollars,</a><a name="ts_655930_656910_S00" > you focus on,</a><a name="ts_656910_658210_S00" > Am I working hard?</a><a name="ts_658330_659410_S00" > Am I learning from others?</a><a name="ts_659570_661130_S00" > Am I enjoying the creative process?</a><a name="ts_661130_663990_S00" > And if you&#x27;re progressing, if you&#x27;re moving in the right direction,</a><a name="ts_664190_665310_S00" > then you are good enough.</a><a name="ts_665530_671010_S00" > You make your identity about the process of growth instead of whether or not you&#x27;ve arrived.</a><a name="ts_671290_673510_S00" > Okay, so number four is...</a><a name="ts_673510_674250_S00" > Is this one?</a><a name="ts_674430_675470_S00" > This one&#x27;s kind of heavy.</a><a name="ts_675910_677870_S00" > So, number four is...</a><a

me.</a><a name="ts_686070_687310_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:11:26]</span> Someone on my channel commented,</a><a name="ts_687310_689750_S00" > Whenever I&#x27;m feeling not good enough, I ask myself,</a><a name="ts_689970_691010_S00" > Not good enough for whom?</a><a name="ts_691290_692630_S00" > Like, who am I trying to impress?</a><a name="ts_692870_694590_S00" > And why does that matter to me?</a><a name="ts_694710_697770_S00" > I try to challenge the thought and list the ways that I am good enough.</a><a name="ts_697930_700770_S00" > So, when my clients feel like they&#x27;re never good enough,</a><a name="ts_700810_703590_S00" > it&#x27;s common when we see that...</a><a name="ts_703590_705110_S00" > When we work on it, when we unpack it,</a><a name="ts_705170_708350_S00" > we see that it&#x27;s really about getting approval from everyone.</a><a name="ts_708650_712350_S00" > They can&#x27;t tolerate it if someone doesn&#x27;t like them or approve of them.</a><a name="ts_712470_712910_S00" > And then they think,</a><a name="ts_713030_716430_S00" > Oh, perhaps I have to change myself to be perfect for them.</a><a name="ts_716430_718710_S00" > And again, this is outsourcing your sense of self,</a><a name="ts_718730_720630_S00" > and it&#x27;s a game that&#x27;s impossible to win.</a><a name="ts_720770_724830_S00" > And really, do you want your self-worth to be determined by your high school bully</a><a name="ts_724830_727090_S00" > who&#x27;s become an internet troll in his mom&#x27;s basement?</a><a name="ts_727090_728270_S00" > I don&#x27;t think so.</a><a name="ts_728390_730970_S00" > So, let&#x27;s look where this comes from,</a><a name="ts_730990_732270_S00" > and then let&#x27;s flip the script.</a><a name="ts_732490_735410_S00" > So, sometimes this comes from messaging from our parents.</a><a name="ts_735590_738370_S00" > They have their own biases, their flaws, and their trauma.</a><a name="ts_738610_739350_S00" > Surprising, I know.</a><a name="ts_739490_744470_S00" > They may be judgmental, critical, demanding, or have impossible expectations.</a><a name="ts_744470_746850_S00" > Maybe they expect you to fulfill their dream.</a><a name="ts_747010_749730_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:27]</span> And as children, we desperately strive for approval,</a><a name="ts_749970_751370_S00" > and we fear disappointing them.</a><a name="ts_751470_754350_S00" > So, it can hurt so much when we feel like we&#x27;re never good enough.</a><a name="ts_754530_757970_S00" > So, what do we do if our parents made us feel that we weren&#x27;t good enough?</a><a name="ts_758130_759930_S00" > I like what Eleanor Roosevelt said.</a><a name="ts_760110_763770_S00" > No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.</a><a name="ts_764030_767930_S00" > As adults, it&#x27;s our responsibility to examine the messages we&#x27;ve been sent,</a><a name="ts_768030_769210_S00" > and then ask ourselves,</a><a name="ts_769290_770710_S00" > Do I agree with this?</a><a name="ts_770710_774090_S00" > Sure, they may have reinforced that messaging over and over again,</a><a name="ts_774170_775210_S00" > and they&#x27;re accountable for that.</a><a name="ts_775350_777570_S00" > But you&#x27;re responsible for what you continue to believe,</a><a name="ts_777590_779210_S00" > what you continue to feed.</a><a name="ts_779410_782730_S00" > So, the goal here is to shift your evaluation of your worth</a><a name="ts_782730_785030_S00" > from being external, what other people think about you,</a><a name="ts_785130_786390_S00" > or what other people say about you,</a><a name="ts_786470_787790_S00" > or what other people tell is worthwhile,</a><a name="ts_788230_788970_S00"

name="ts_794090_796630_S00" > or at the very least, its own dedicated video.</a><a name="ts_796630_798270_S00" > So, we&#x27;ll do a deep dive in the future.</a><a name="ts_798450_800430_S00" > But for now, if you catch yourself thinking,</a><a name="ts_800610_801870_S00" > I&#x27;m never good enough,</a><a name="ts_801910_804110_S00" > you could choose to notice that thought,</a><a
