We&#x27;ve been told forever,</a><a name="ts_49290_50190_" > parenting comes naturally.</a><a name="ts_50510_51450_" > You should just know what to do.</a><a name="ts_51550_52750_" > I hear this from

told to us.</a><a name="ts_78490_80330_" > It&#x27;s something that just comes naturally,</a><a name="ts_80350_81890_" > which is why we feel shame,</a><a name="ts_81890_84730_" > and we stay alone when we&#x27;re struggling.</a><a name="ts_84970_86850_" > That&#x27;s actually the biggest thing I hope to change.</a><a name="ts_87150_89030_" > And so, yes, there are so many things we can do</a><a name="ts_89030_91510_" > to work on our parenting or to work on emotion regulation,</a><a name="ts_91510_93088_" > which is definitely a part of parenting.</a><a name="ts_93760_96280_" > Attachment

none of the skills to manage those emotions.</a><a name="ts_103950_108190_" > That gap explains why kids and adults act out.</a><a name="ts_108310_110630_" > It&#x27;s when emotions are greater than skills.</a><a name="ts_111520_113700_" > But the thing about these skills that&#x27;s different</a><a name="ts_113700_117050_" > than some other skills is they&#x27;re rarely just taught</a><a

name="ts_124230_128410_" > through their attachment with their parents.</a><a name="ts_128410_129824_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_129824_133010_" > This brings up the concept of dysregulation</a><a name="ts_133010_135010_" > and then co-regulation</a><a name="ts_135010_138310_" > and then the thing we all want, emotion regulation.</a><a name="ts_138530_139328_" > So let me explain.</a><a name="ts_140064_142900_" > Because kids are born with all of the emotions</a><a name="ts_142900_144360_" > and none of the skills,</a><a name="ts_144680_148320_" > they&#x27;re often in a state of dysregulation.</a><a name="ts_148580_150580_" > All that really means is my emotions</a><a name="ts_150580_151720_" > are greater than my skills,</a><a name="ts_151720_155552_" > so my emotions come out as a tantrum,</a><a name="ts_156160_157860_" > as a huge outburst,</a><a name="ts_158060_159820_" > maybe as an I hate you,</a><a name="ts_160000_162496_" > as flailing on the floor.</a><a name="ts_163328_166030_" > That is a state of dysregulation.</a><a name="ts_166250_168470_" > My kid is having big emotions</a><a name="ts_168830_170390_" > but doesn&#x27;t have skills to manage.</a><a name="ts_171232_173056_" > Okay, what&#x27;s co-regulation?</a><a name="ts_173056_174368_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_174368_176170_" > One of the ways and the most powerful ways</a><a name="ts_176170_180230_" > kids get from dysregulation to regulation</a><a name="ts_180910_185860_" > is through borrowing a parent&#x27;s regulation.</a><a name="ts_186816_187808_" > So let&#x27;s picture the scene.</a><a name="ts_188800_189810_" > My kid is melting down.</a><a name="ts_189990_190330_" > Why?</a><a name="ts_191328_193950_" > Because I cut their grilled cheese into

floor.</a><a name="ts_212800_213856_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_213856_218610_" > How kids learn eventually to regulate even in the face of frustration or disappointment</a><a name="ts_218610_224768_" > is that they experience over and over and over and over and over again,</a><a name="ts_225408_232960_" > a caregiver who was able to stay relatively calm in the moment the kid was dysregulated.</a><a name="ts_233300_236800_" > It&#x27;s almost like, here&#x27;s my dysregulated kid flailing on the floor.</a><a name="ts_237040_243630_" > Here&#x27;s my calm, and it&#x27;s almost like the calm can transfer from my body to my kids.</a><a name="ts_243630_247130_" > And now my kid has this much calm.</a><a name="ts_247270_248960_" > Not much, but it&#x27;s growing.</a><a name="ts_248960_250048_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_250048_255680_" > You can almost imagine this as, well, when will my kid be able to stay totally calm?</a><a name="ts_255880_259720_" > A big part of it is the repetition over and over and over.</a><a name="ts_259940_261460_" > My parents stayed calm.</a><a name="ts_261600_264320_" > I&#x27;ve absorbed through co-regulation.</a><a name="ts_264780_273024_" > Enough of that calm regulation that it&#x27;s in my body and I can access it.</a><a name="ts_273664_278330_" > See, the scariest thing to a kid is when they get dysregulated and overwhelmed,</a><a name="ts_278570_284288_" > which is essentially like, the feelings in my body are so scary that they take me over.</a><a name="ts_284896_286016_" > It&#x27;s such a helpless state.</a><a name="ts_286848_291600_" > But imagine your four-year-old in that helpless state, and then they see their parent,</a><a name="ts_291620_297260_" > who they depend on for survival, and see, oh no, the things that feel overwhelming to me</a><a name="ts_297820_300192_" > are also overwhelming to my parent.</a><a name="ts_300736_302520_" > My parent can&#x27;t stay calm with this.</a><a name="ts_302720_306080_" > That&#x27;s that situation where you&#x27;re freaking out when there&#x27;s turbulence</a><a name="ts_306080_308970_" > and the pilot&#x27;s freaking out when there&#x27;s turbulence.</a><a name="ts_309952_314180_" > The way you&#x27;re eventually, even as an adult, going to feel safe amidst turbulence</a><a name="ts_314680_317420_" > is actually probably going on flights over and over that have turbulence</a><a name="ts_317420_321210_" > and absorbing the regulation from the pilot.</a><a name="ts_321310_322710_" > You start to believe it yourself.</a><a name="ts_322710_323968_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_323968_329088_" > And so through a kid&#x27;s attachment relationship with a caregiver,</a><a name="ts_330048_335760_" > they start to see things that overwhelm me might not overwhelm me forever.</a><a name="ts_335760_344130_" > Things that kind of knock me off my rocker and feel intolerable actually are tolerable</a><a name="ts_344130_347328_" > to my most important, safest adult.</a><a name="ts_348288_353530_" > And that over and over brings a kid from dysregulation to co-regulation</a><a name="ts_353530_358270_" > to that eventual state of emotion regulation.</a><a name="ts_358510_362190_" > I should say that we never fully live in emotion regulation.</a><a name="ts_362610_368210_" > All adults still need other adults in time to help co-regulate.</a><a name="ts_368210_372320_" > That&#x27;s why when you&#x27;ve had a horrible day and you go out with some friends</a><a name="ts_372320_374220_" > and you&#x27;re having dinner and they say,</a><a name="ts_374320_375300_" > Oh, that stinks.</a><a name="ts_375340_376200_" > I&#x27;ve been there too.</a><a name="ts_376500_377820_" > You&#x27;re like, wait, that&#x27;s so weird.</a><a name="ts_377960_381580_" > Nothing about my day changed, but I&#x27;m actually feeling better.</a><a name="ts_381960_386140_" > We absorb some of the validation and calm and maybe</a><a name="ts_386140_389560_" > someone believes in us in a way we forgot that we could believe in ourself.</a><a name="ts_389740_392840_" > We still need co-regulation even as adults,</a><a name="ts_392840_399070_" > but hopefully we&#x27;re not as dependent on it as often as our kids.</a><a name="ts_399350_401830_" > And I promise you, your kid won&#x27;t be as an adult</a><a name="ts_401830_406144_" > if they&#x27;ve gone through that motion a bunch of times in their early years.</a><a name="ts_406144_407200_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_407200_411020_" > Our ability to hold opposing truths at the same time</a><a name="ts_411020_414000_" > is one of the most important things for our mental health</a><a name="ts_414000_416480_" > and successful adult relationships.</a><a name="ts_416620_417760_" > I&#x27;ll explain both.</a><a name="ts_418432_421710_" > Our feelings, our internal states are very complicated.</a><a name="ts_422350_426176_" > Very rarely do we just feel one thing.</a><a name="ts_426784_429340_" > For example, in parenthood, you might feel like,</a><a name="ts_429640_434048_" > I love my kid in a way I&#x27;ve never loved anyone in the world.</a><a name="ts_434048_435104_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_435104_440480_" > And you might also think, I kind of miss my pre-child life.</a><a name="ts_441216_445870_" > If we&#x27;re forced to reconcile those two thoughts as if only one of them can be true,</a><a name="ts_445870_450090_" > when I have the thought of, oh my goodness, I miss my pre-child life,</a><a name="ts_450110_451490_" > I start telling myself a story.</a><a name="ts_451650_452690_" > I&#x27;m a horrible person.</a><a name="ts_452790_454250_" > What kind of parent would say that?</a><a name="ts_454330_456030_" > I had to do so much to get pregnant.</a><a name="ts_456170_456910_" > I&#x27;m a monster.</a><a name="ts_457150_458710_" > Good parents don&#x27;t think that way.</a><a name="ts_458790_461568_" > You can imagine the negative downward spiral from there,</a><a name="ts_462400_466560_" > as if having that thought means I don&#x27;t love the heck out of my kid.</a><a name="ts_466980_470540_" > When we can say to ourselves, and this is kind of a good inside catchphrase,</a><a name="ts_470900_473056_" > wait, two things are true.</a><a name="ts_473792_477696_" > I love my kid more than I&#x27;ve loved anyone or anything in the world.</a><a name="ts_478528_482260_" > And there are moments when I miss my pre-child life.</a><a name="ts_482700_484460_" > I don&#x27;t have to reconcile those two things.</a><a name="ts_484460_486340_" > I can just say they&#x27;re both true.</a><a name="ts_486640_488576_" > I have a type of internal peace.</a><a name="ts_489120_492620_" > Now, being able to hold two seemingly oppositional truths</a><a name="ts_492620_496680_" > is also critical for any successful relationship.</a><a name="ts_496680_499600_" > Meaning my relationship with my kid, my relationship

partnership,</a><a name="ts_640480_643360_" > definitely in your relationship with in-laws, you have to understand boundaries.</a><a name="ts_643840_646980_" > And there&#x27;s something I hear all the time, right, in passing.</a><a name="ts_647200_649340_" > My mother-in-law doesn&#x27;t respect my boundaries.</a><a name="ts_649620_651740_" > My son doesn&#x27;t respect my boundaries.</a><a

person has a correct definition of boundaries.</a><a name="ts_661856_666290_" > So let me share my definition of boundaries, and then we&#x27;ll go through why it&#x27;s so important,</a><a name="ts_666290_672010_" > and why boundaries actually help us connect to other people, as opposed to boundaries getting</a><a name="ts_672010_674240_" > in the way of connection, which is what a lot of us think.</a><a name="ts_675200_682464_" > Boundaries are what we tell someone we will do, and they require the other person to do nothing.</a><a name="ts_683104_684930_" > So there&#x27;s like a two-part checklist, and I love this.</a><a name="ts_684990_685710_" > It&#x27;s very practical.</a><a name="ts_685910_688990_" > The next time you think you&#x27;re setting a boundary, you can check

think I set a boundary.</a><a name="ts_697184_698944_" > Did I tell someone what I will do?</a><a name="ts_699776_703470_" > And does the success of my boundary require the other person to do nothing?</a><a name="ts_703710_706590_" > You have to have two yeses for it to count as a boundary.</a><a name="ts_706590_712096_" > So when I say to my son, right, and this is a great example, because I live in New York City,</a><a name="ts_712736_719760_" > I live in an elevator building, and I have a kid who has about 0% people-pleasing in him, right?</a><a name="ts_719860_721340_" > So

get into the elevator, don&#x27;t press all the elevator buttons.</a><a name="ts_731390_735552_" > It&#x27;s very annoying to stop at all the floors, or it&#x27;s disrespectful to other people waiting.</a><a name="ts_736256_739170_" > And then my son goes in and just presses all the buttons.</a><a name="ts_739170_746560_" > So many parents would say, my kid doesn&#x27;t respect my boundaries, or get off the couch.</a><a name="ts_747520_749470_" > Hey, stop jumping on the couch.</a><a name="ts_749550_750790_" > Hey, I&#x27;m gonna count to five.</a><a name="ts_751150_754130_" >

name="ts_758848_758016_" > No.</a><a name="ts_758848_762930_" > Does the success of my boundary require my kid to do nothing?</a><a name="ts_763370_763776_" > No.</a><a name="ts_764480_766464_" > In both situations, this is so powerful.</a><a name="ts_767008_767990_" > I am making a request.</a><a name="ts_768350_770910_" > I&#x27;m requesting for my kid not to press the buttons.</a><a name="ts_770930_773750_" > I&#x27;m requesting for my kid to get off the couch.</a><a name="ts_773950_775370_" > No, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with a request.</a><a name="ts_775510_777472_" > We make requests all the time.</a><a name="ts_777472_778496_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_778496_785472_" > And if our kid especially isn&#x27;t able to follow a request, and we think it&#x27;s really, really important,</a><a name="ts_786048_787730_" > we have to set a true boundary.</a><a name="ts_788170_789130_" > Now watch for the difference.</a><a name="ts_789130_793890_" > Hey, when we go into the elevator, I&#x27;m going to stand between you and the buttons.</a><a name="ts_794210_797190_" > And sweetie, even if you lunge for the buttons, I will stop you.</a><a name="ts_797570_800230_" > And then if you&#x27;re wondering what I would do, yeah, I would get ready.</a><a name="ts_800350_802570_" > I&#x27;d have my, like, move ready when my kid lunges.</a><a name="ts_802630_804448_" > I would just say, I&#x27;m not gonna let you do that.</a><a name="ts_805312_806070_" > That&#x27;s a great boundary.</a><a name="ts_806470_807630_" > Not we don&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_807730_809850_" > It&#x27;s like a weird thing we all learn to say to our kid.</a><a name="ts_810110_811310_" > We don&#x27;t press buttons.</a><a name="ts_811410_812370_" > We don&#x27;t hit.</a><a name="ts_812530_813770_" > Hopefully your kid knows that.</a><a name="ts_814070_814990_" > Not we don&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_815550_817510_" > That&#x27;s really giving away all your authority.</a><a name="ts_817690_818430_" > Listen to this language.</a><a name="ts_818430_819904_" > I&#x27;m not gonna let you do that.</a><a name="ts_820512_821440_" > And then I&#x27;m gonna stop my kid.</a><a

it.</a><a name="ts_842850_844150_" > They don&#x27;t respect my boundary.</a><a name="ts_844510_846530_" > Why am I giving my six-year-old my power?</a><a name="ts_846530_849370_" > And then in doing that, I actually lose connection.</a><a name="ts_849530_852830_" > Because you know what happens in that TV example or the couch example?</a><a name="ts_853010_854210_" > My kid doesn&#x27;t get off the couch.</a><a name="ts_854310_855360_" > They don&#x27;t turn off the TV.</a><a name="ts_855904_856928_" > And I end up yelling at them.</a><a name="ts_857760_859360_" > Which really diminishes

TV.</a><a name="ts_878370_879290_" > It&#x27;s just not realistic.</a><a name="ts_879290_880650_" > So what should I do?</a><a name="ts_880790_883510_" > The next time we watch TV, I&#x27;m going to

We finally get to Blockbuster. I go,</a><a name="ts_2183450_2187850_" > and you&#x27;re winding through the aisles, and then you see the image. And sometimes, as most of us</a><a name="ts_2187850_2193170_" > remember, is you look behind and you&#x27;re like, oh man, they&#x27;re out. They don&#x27;t even have that movie.</a><a name="ts_2193170_2201550_" > or maybe they do, but it took such a long time between wanting and imagining and having.

And you know what? With reading, nobody is just delivering</a><a name="ts_2252740_2260480_" > to you right away the ability to read.
