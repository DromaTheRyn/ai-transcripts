action.</a><a name="ts_285040_288600_S01" > Okay, so the foundation of healthy self-esteem is integrity to your values.</a><a name="ts_288700_291220_S01" > But one thing I see with people who are trying hard,</a><a name="ts_291220_293180_S01" > but still feel terrible about themselves,</a><a name="ts_293180_297280_S01" > is that they fuel low self-esteem with a bad habit of

habit.</a><a name="ts_315720_316620_S01" > So this is number two.</a><a name="ts_317120_319780_S01" > Personal name-calling and put-downs are not allowed.</a><a name="ts_320080_323200_S01" > You&#x27;ve got to replace name-calling with a growth mindset.</a><a name="ts_323260_324880_S01" > So instead of saying, I&#x27;m so stupid,</a><a name="ts_325040_326940_S01" > say, hmm, I&#x27;m still learning.</a><a name="ts_327160_330160_S01" > Or, I haven&#x27;t figured this out yet, but I&#x27;ll keep trying.</a><a name="ts_331104_333520_S01" > We&#x27;ve got to replace perfectionism with compassion.</a><a name="ts_333520_335560_S01" > So instead of saying, like, I should have never made that mistake,</a><a name="ts_335620_336280_S01" > it was so stupid,</a><a name="ts_336420_339720_S01" > that gets replaced with making a mistake is human.</a><a name="ts_339840_341240_S01" > I&#x27;m going to learn from this and try again.</a><a name="ts_341780_344420_S01" > So to make this exercise more powerful,</a><a name="ts_344420_346840_S01" > I want you to write down the names you call yourself,</a><a name="ts_347240_350640_S01" > and then write down the helpful lines that you&#x27;ll replace them with,</a><a name="ts_350740_352280_S01" > so that you&#x27;re ready when you need them.</a><a name="ts_352280_355360_S01" > When you have your list of negative names,</a><a name="ts_355500_358380_S01" > you can even ask a therapist or a friend or even AI</a><a name="ts_358800_361520_S01" > to help you write out these replacement phrases.</a><a name="ts_362260_364880_S01" > Because a lot of times we have a hard time coming up with them</a><a name="ts_364880_367780_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:04]</span> when our brain&#x27;s been stuck in a rut of self-criticism for a long time.</a><a name="ts_368240_370980_S01" > And then you could also, like, take a screenshot of them</a><a name="ts_370980_374080_S01" > or take a picture of them and put them on your lock screen on your phone.</a><a name="ts_374220_375200_S01" > Don&#x27;t put your negative list there.</a><a name="ts_375220_376420_S01" > You don&#x27;t want to reinforce that.</a><a name="ts_376420_379600_S01" > So, I&#x27;m such an idiot becomes, I&#x27;m still learning.</a><a name="ts_380384_383860_S01" > Instead of, I&#x27;m such a loser, use, I&#x27;m going to work hard and do my best.</a><a name="ts_384000_384600_S01" > Good things will come.</a><a name="ts_384700_386160_S01" > This will feel awkward at first.</a><a name="ts_386340_390280_S01" > It might feel fake or pandering because you&#x27;re not used to your new self-talk.</a><a name="ts_390480_392960_S01" > But we are doing mental reps here.</a><a name="ts_393060_395720_S01" > It&#x27;s like swinging a golf club for the first time.</a><a name="ts_395860_397200_S01" > Like, I have no idea how to play golf.</a><a name="ts_397380_403360_S01" > But it takes practice to replace bad habits with new mental muscle memory.</a><a name="ts_403600_405320_S01" > Okay, here&#x27;s the second thing that makes you insecure.</a><a name="ts_405320_407180_S01" > It&#x27;s mental filtering.</a><a name="ts_407560_411140_S01" > So, negative mental filtering is when you ignore all the good things you do</a><a name="ts_411140_415800_S01" > and you place a ton of attention on your mistakes, your flaws, your shortcomings, and your awkwardness.</a><a name="ts_416140_418160_S01" > Now, most people don&#x27;t notice that they&#x27;re doing it.</a><a name="ts_418300_420800_S01" > But let me ask you a question.</a><a name="ts_420980_427552_S01" > Let&#x27;s say that at work, you get nine good jobs or thank yous and one piece of criticism.</a><a name="ts_428288_430208_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:08]</span> Which one will you think about at night?</a><a name="ts_431168_431600_S01" > The criticism.</a><a name="ts_431900_433140_S01" > This is negativity bias.</a><a name="ts_433260_436380_S01" > Your brain naturally focuses on the negative and filters out the positive.</a><a name="ts_436380_440980_S01" > For some people, this becomes a deep rut where they literally cannot think of anything good about themselves.</a><a name="ts_441260_445120_S01" > So instead, let&#x27;s retrain your brain to start noticing the good.</a><a name="ts_445760_447180_S01" > It&#x27;s not that it&#x27;s not there.</a><a name="ts_447340_453240_S01" > It just feels like you never do anything right because you&#x27;ve trained your brain to ignore the good things that happen.</a><a name="ts_453340_458080_S01" > You&#x27;ve conditioned yourself to look for the bad and punish yourself with that over and over again.</a><a name="ts_458080_463880_S01" > To restore balance to the force, do the three good things exercise every day for two weeks.</a><a name="ts_464020_465000_S01" > It&#x27;s very simple.</a><a name="ts_465220_468040_S01" > Each day before you go to bed, write three good things you did today.</a><a name="ts_468060_471400_S01" > And this is going to counterbalance that constant focus on negativity.</a><a name="ts_471600_474120_S01" > It&#x27;s going to train your brain to look for the good you do.</a><a name="ts_474500_480980_S01" > Research shows that this simple exercise for two weeks can lead to a positive mood for six months.</a><a name="ts_480980_484380_S01" > Like a measurable decrease in anxiety and depression.</a><a name="ts_484640_490900_S01" > Okay, so now we&#x27;ve got an idea of where we&#x27;re going and we&#x27;re learning to protect ourselves from the things that throw us off course.</a><a name="ts_490980_492880_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:10]</span> Now we&#x27;re going to start to build up our momentum.</a><a name="ts_493060_494900_S01" > We&#x27;re going to explore your gifts.</a><a name="ts_495220_496220_S01" > What lights you up?</a><a name="ts_496240_497000_S01" > What gets you

name="ts_502900_504140_S01" > You don&#x27;t have to be.</a><a name="ts_504300_506280_S01" > Maybe you&#x27;re a poet and you touch emotion with words.</a><a name="ts_506280_510240_S01" > Maybe you&#x27;re great at making cookies or you just enjoy cooking, right?</a><a name="ts_510440_511776_S01" > This is not my gift.</a><a name="ts_512320_516700_S01" > When I worked at a youth camp, I used to compare myself all the time to the other counselors.</a><a name="ts_516700_520600_S01" > They were super funny and outgoing and energetic.</a><a name="ts_521060_525940_S01" > And I just tried to constantly hate myself into being more fun.</a><a name="ts_526920_528040_S01" > It did not work.</a><a name="ts_528140_534240_S01" > But then I found that I&#x27;m actually really great at having quiet, deep, one-on-one conversations with people.</a><a name="ts_534420_536600_S01" > I&#x27;m good at caring and empathizing.</a><a name="ts_536720_540800_S01" > I&#x27;m thoughtful and I can ask good questions and make people feel safe.</a><a name="ts_541040_543860_S01" > Now, I&#x27;m not necessarily the most outgoing person.</a><a name="ts_543880_550260_S01" > But when I line up my opportunities with my gifts, I end up doing therapy and working in a wilderness therapy camp</a><a name="ts_550260_554000_S01" > and shifting my socializing to small group activities.</a><a name="ts_554220_559920_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:09:14]</span> The thing that I thought was bad about me, which was being quieter, was actually one of my great strengths.</a><a

Power of Introverts in a World That Can&#x27;t Stop Talking,</a><a name="ts_573880_577760_S01" > this book changed how I saw myself and helped me really appreciate my gifts.</a><a

the little things on each visit.</a><a name="ts_648950_652270_S01" > And then one week, the father was out of town, and the son went on his own.</a><a name="ts_652430_656290_S01" > And when the father returned, the son&#x27;s face was, like, glowing with pride</a><a name="ts_656290_659110_S01" > as he told his dad how he fixed the neighbor&#x27;s computer.</a><a name="ts_659210_663250_S01" > He helped her figure out the remote control, and he took her trash cans to the curb.</a><a name="ts_663510_669190_S01" > Like, I get so excited about this because as soon as someone stops dwelling on how bad of a person they are,</a><a name="ts_669250_672050_S01" > and they start to connect and help and love and serve,</a><a name="ts_672370_676130_S01" > they start to get this light in their eyes and this bounce in their step.</a><a name="ts_676130_681250_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:11:16]</span> Now, like, this is not going to be comfortable or easy or even self-focused,</a><a

Enough said.</a><a name="ts_703650_704750_S01" > Okay, here&#x27;s the last thing.</a><a name="ts_704850_705830_S01" > I promise, okay?</a><a name="ts_706070_707270_S01" > Stop trying to hide yourself.</a><a name="ts_707450_710330_S01" > Show the world the weird things you&#x27;re passionate about.</a><a name="ts_710530_715470_S01" > Get excited about fossils or anime or laughing loudly or sea glass.</a><a name="ts_715750_720250_S01" > If you&#x27;ve got deep wounds and hurts or weird passions or awkward teeth,</a><a name="ts_720470_725130_S01" > every time we hide ourselves, we accidentally reinforce that fear cycle.</a><a name="ts_725130_728970_S01" > And when we show ourselves, we come to find that we are safe.</a><a name="ts_729150_732130_S01" > Do not wait until you feel confident to take action.</a><a name="ts_732130_733550_S01" > That is not how confidence works.</a><a name="ts_733570_737250_S01" > We have to share ourselves first, and then the confidence is going to grow.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_737430_738410_S00" >S00: <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:17]</span> Okay, so there you have it.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_738450_741210_S01" >S01: <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:18]</span> Six practices that will help you improve your self-esteem</a><a name="ts_741210_745990_S01" > from your thoughts all the way to the ones that touch at your core.</a><a name="ts_746050_748670_S01" > You can build self-esteem in a practical way,</a><a name="ts_748670_751470_S01" > and I hope you find that as you use these practices,</a><a name="ts_751470_754830_S01" > you&#x27;ll see for yourself that self-esteem isn&#x27;t about ego,</a><a name="ts_755130_756810_S01" > or self-aggrandizement.</a><a name="ts_756990_760130_S01" > It&#x27;s rooted in belonging and contribution and purpose</a><a name="ts_760130_762590_S01" > and authentic human connection.</a><a name="ts_763360_764050_S01" > Okay, you got this.</a><a name="ts_764290_767030_S01" > Pop this list into your phone and set some reminders</a><a name="ts_767030_769088_S01" > to start taking action today.</a><a name="ts_769760_772290_S01" > And again, if you&#x27;d like to do that values clarification exercise,</a><a name="ts_772290_774070_S01" > check out the link in the description.</a><a name="ts_774270_776480_S01" > Thank you for watching and take care.</a><a name="ts_777440_780070_S01" > Hey, real quick, if you found any part of this video helpful,</a><a name="ts_780110_782410_S01" > I would really appreciate it if you give it a thumbs up</a><a name="ts_782410_785330_S01" > or share it with someone who could benefit from it today.</a><a name="ts_785330_786490_S01" > Really appreciate it.</a><a name="ts_786630_787994_S01" > Thank you so much and take care.</a></p></div></body>
