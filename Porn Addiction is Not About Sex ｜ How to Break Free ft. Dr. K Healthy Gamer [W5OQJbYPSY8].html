name="ts_0_2280_" >What are some techniques that you use for people who have porn addiction?</a><a name="ts_2460_4440_" > Like, how do you help them get through that?</a><a name="ts_4600_8660_" > I think a lot of it is, like, understanding their emotions.</a><a name="ts_8760_12720_" > So when I think about pornography addiction, so remember that any addiction brings pleasure</a><a name="ts_12720_13660_" > and takes away pain.</a><a name="ts_14020_19380_" > So if you can reduce the need to take away pain, then you&#x27;re, you&#x27;re gonna melt away the</a><a name="ts_19380_20288_" > pornography addiction.</a><a name="ts_20864_23190_" > So a couple of things that are correlated with pornography addiction.</a><a name="ts_23350_30850_" > So if you look at multivariate regression analyses, there are two variables that correlate very</a><a name="ts_30850_32170_" > highly with a pornography addiction.</a><a name="ts_32470_35070_" > One of them is meaninglessness in life.</a><a name="ts_35510_41990_" > So generally speaking, if you can help someone have a reason not to watch pornography and jerk</a><a name="ts_41990_44890_" > off in the middle of the day, then that will help them a lot.</a><a name="ts_45070_49190_" > So what happens is, this is my population, but like, you know, these are people who are</a><a name="ts_49190_53890_" > oftentimes young men in their 20s, and they&#x27;re like falling behind in some way.</a><a name="ts_54010_58490_" > And it&#x27;s like, 4pm on a Thursday, they&#x27;re not really working and like, what else do they</a><a name="ts_58490_59010_" > have to do?</a><a name="ts_59010_64230_" > So as we start building a life of meaning, like the need for pornography seems to decrease.</a><a name="ts_64230_65248_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_65248_65870_" > That&#x27;s one thing.</a><a name="ts_66170_69570_" > The second thing is that oftentimes, remember, this is emotional regulation.</a><a name="ts_69990_75710_" > And people will have a lot of stored emotions from things like traumatic experiences growing</a><a name="ts_75710_78310_" > up, romantic relationships, all kinds of other stuff.</a><a name="ts_78490_86810_" > So as we metabolize that storehouse of emotion, it becomes easier to manage emotions from day to</a><a name="ts_86810_89990_" > day, they&#x27;re kind of like built up and your mind kind of stores them in the subconscious.</a><a name="ts_90310_92430_" > So if we look at something like processing trauma.</a><a name="ts_92570_96130_" > So I do a lot of like trauma processing for people with pornography addiction.</a><a name="ts_96490_101090_" > And that sort of takes some of the gas out of the tank that&#x27;s fueling the addiction.</a><a name="ts_101270_105350_" > The third thing to do is to reduce emotions in the present.</a><a name="ts_105350_110170_" > So teach them alternate coping mechanisms that they can use to manage emotions.</a><a name="ts_110410_113770_" > And oftentimes, it&#x27;s like really life oriented stuff.</a><a name="ts_113970_119370_" > So if I&#x27;m living at home and my parents are toxic, like learning to set better boundaries</a><a name="ts_119370_123210_" > is one of the best things to teach someone who struggles with pornography addiction.</a><a name="ts_123210_128170_" > Because usually what&#x27;s going on is these are people that have someone in their life who</a><a name="ts_128170_132090_" > is sending them toxicity, but they feel so guilty at cutting them out.</a><a name="ts_132190_135910_" > This can even be someone like a romantic partner or spouse, it can be a parent.</a><a name="ts_136190_141340_" > And as they&#x27;re like receiving the stress, it&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;ll joke with some of my patients</a><a name="ts_141340_145580_" > that you have an emotional umbilical cord, they&#x27;re connected to someone else.</a><a name="ts_145720_150360_" > And another human is like transmitting negative emotions to them like a waste product.</a><a name="ts_150360_155360_" > And then they have to turn to substances or pornography or whatever to like offload that</a><a name="ts_155360_156020_" > emotional stuff.</a><a name="ts_156200_161480_" > So boundary setting, emotional regulation techniques, processing trauma, and like really building</a><a name="ts_161480_165420_" > purpose in life tends to be like a pretty good, like good outcomes.</a><a name="ts_165640_170000_" > You know, so many things come to mind, but I think we&#x27;re seeing particularly in young men,</a><a name="ts_170120_176160_" > like we know that amounts of sex or frequency of sex is decreasing and that the even birth rates</a><a name="ts_176160_176940_" > are decreasing.</a><a name="ts_177620_184200_" > And so do you think this is sort of part of all of this like external stimulation that&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_184200_187520_" > around and then they feel sort of, I mean, this is a theory for me, right?</a><a name="ts_187580_189760_" > They feel less meaning, right?</a><a name="ts_189880_194560_" > Because they&#x27;re not actually having success in finding someone or meeting someone, or it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_194560_196340_" > just easier to access pornography.</a><a name="ts_196780_200280_" > And then they&#x27;re like, you know, they&#x27;re still not connecting with other people.</a><a name="ts_200440_202480_" > They&#x27;re using pornography because they still feel bad.</a><a name="ts_202560_204320_" > Of course, we talked about the cycle a little bit.</a><a name="ts_204320_207840_" > But is it sort of like, are these things contributing to that?</a><a name="ts_208020_209620_" > When you say these things, what do you mean?</a><a name="ts_209780_215380_" > Like meaning, are we seeing people get porn addiction because they&#x27;re either having stress</a><a name="ts_215380_215940_" > in their life?</a><a name="ts_216200_220240_" > So say they&#x27;re not coupled with somebody, say they are trying to meet people, but they&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_220240_224140_" > having difficulty because I think the dating, the dating world has changed, right?</a><a name="ts_224280_227000_" > With dating apps and how people communicate and meet each other.</a><a name="ts_227120_228900_" > It&#x27;s very different from when you and I were younger.</a><a name="ts_228900_235050_" > And so I think that is, is a very different, different sort of place to navigate.</a><a name="ts_235190_237330_" > Like women are looking for a certain kind of man.</a><a name="ts_237430_241130_" > And if you don&#x27;t fill that category, you are immediately filtered out, right?</a><a name="ts_241230_245610_" > So women are doing the top five, 10% of men are trying to aim for them.</a><a name="ts_245750_250030_" > And, and then there&#x27;s a lot of men who are not having success in meeting women.</a><a name="ts_250190_250590_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_250750_253270_" > So, so it sounds like you have a theory that that&#x27;s at play.</a><a name="ts_253350_254450_" > And I think that&#x27;s completely reasonable.</a><a name="ts_254630_257250_" > So let&#x27;s just play around with that a little bit.</a><a name="ts_257250_260530_" > So the first thing is that, you know, this idea that women are dating the top five to</a><a name="ts_260530_263730_" > 10% of men, I assume you&#x27;re talking about like Tinder statistics.</a><a name="ts_263870_263970_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_264090_266970_" > Like those, I mean, cause that&#x27;s where you can filter by height and by, you know.</a><a name="ts_267050_267170_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_267170_271810_" > So I think that there&#x27;s a couple of interesting, like once you really look at the data, which</a><a name="ts_271810_274650_" > I don&#x27;t know if you have, but I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m sure, you know, anyone who&#x27;s trained in statistics.</a><a name="ts_274670_281830_" > So when, when they say they&#x27;re dating the top 10% of men, there&#x27;s this idea that one dude is dating</a><a name="ts_281830_284330_" > like nine women, whereas that&#x27;s not usually what happens.</a><a name="ts_284330_290390_" > So if you look at something like Tinder, it&#x27;s like a seven to nine men to one woman</a><a name="ts_290390_291168_" > like ratio.</a><a name="ts_291712_296370_" > So when they say they&#x27;re dating, it&#x27;s still oftentimes one dude is dating one guy or maybe</a><a name="ts_296370_301310_" > people are kind of at the top, but like there&#x27;s such a lopsided gender ratio that it&#x27;s still</a><a name="ts_301310_303630_" > like closer to one to one in some ways.</a><a name="ts_303770_305530_" > It depends on the studies that you look at and stuff like that.</a><a name="ts_305670_310270_" > So I think that this creates this idea that a lot of men have that like, oh my God, there&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_310270_313750_" > like these chads at the top that are like banging lots of girls.</a><a name="ts_314070_314170_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_314310_317790_" > I don&#x27;t think the reality is quite like that when you really look at the statistics.</a><a name="ts_317970_321790_" > So that&#x27;s one piece, but I think another thing to really consider that I think you kind of</a><a name="ts_321790_327870_" > hit the nail on the head is that it is harder for men and women to find a good match.</a><a name="ts_328190_328310_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_328510_329630_" > There are many reasons for that.</a><a name="ts_329750_335570_" > I think one reason is that, so if we look at like what women want in partners and this is</a><a name="ts_336010_339000_" > generalizations, so you can look at statistics, right?</a><a name="ts_339180_345100_" > So like the idea of a dating a dude who lives at home at the age of 28 is like, eh, I don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_345100_349740_" > want someone who&#x27;s living with their parents, but 50% of people under the age of 30 who are</a><a name="ts_349740_351960_" > adults still live with their parents, men and women both.</a><a name="ts_352240_352360_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_352620_354820_" > So the economic situation is changing.</a><a name="ts_354820_359760_" > So the idea of like an independent man at 28 just doesn&#x27;t apply to 50% of the population.</a><a name="ts_360060_360200_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_360660_363040_" > Another good example of this is most women.</a><a name="ts_363040_367700_" > I want to say like statistics are historically somewhere around 70 to 80% of women will</a><a name="ts_367700_372440_" > want to date a man who makes more money than they do, but 60% of college graduates are now</a><a name="ts_372440_372740_" > women.</a><a name="ts_373100_373200_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_373300_379120_" > So what we&#x27;re starting to see is as equality of income increases, that expectation becomes</a><a name="ts_379120_380448_" > harder and harder to fill.</a><a name="ts_381088_385216_" > So whatever the reason is, and there are all kinds of challenges that women have as well,</a><a name="ts_386048_388180_" > and they get tons of dick pics and all kinds of other things.</a><a name="ts_388480_388620_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_388800_392736_" > So it&#x27;s definitely making it harder for men to date.</a><a name="ts_393408_396710_" > Now that&#x27;s just on the gender side, but there&#x27;s a whole other set of things that&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_396710_402830_" > like screwing up dudes too, which is that, you know, as men, like we have very poor emotional</a><a name="ts_402830_403730_" > regulation skills.</a><a name="ts_404230_408410_" > We&#x27;re not really taught how to express emotions beyond anger.</a><a name="ts_408750_410310_" > Um, we&#x27;re unlikely.</a><a name="ts_410510_413710_" > It&#x27;s like hard for us to engage in psychotherapy, which I don&#x27;t think is a weakness of men.</a><a name="ts_413790_417710_" > I think there&#x27;s some systemic biases in psychotherapy that are against men.</a><a name="ts_417710_422390_" > So if you look at studies on couples counseling, like you ask, ask men, why don&#x27;t you want</a><a name="ts_422390_423510_" > to go to couples counseling?</a><a name="ts_423590_425530_" > And what they, what happens is they feel outgunned.</a><a name="ts_425750_431010_" > So anytime they go see a couples counselor, their female partner, assuming a heteronormative</a><a name="ts_431010_434450_" > relationship knows how to articulate their feelings.</a><a name="ts_434450_436370_" > And the man doesn&#x27;t know how to do that.</a><a name="ts_436510_436810_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_436910_440550_" > So the, the, the wife is like articulating, like he does this and this makes me feel this</a><a name="ts_440550_440750_" > way.</a><a name="ts_440750_443210_" > And the therapist kind of like gets on their side.</a><a name="ts_443430_445590_" > And so men sort of feel like outmatched.</a><a name="ts_445650_447470_" > And I think that there&#x27;s a good reason for that.</a><a name="ts_447470_448736_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_448736_450780_" > So men are, are really struggling right now.</a><a name="ts_450940_452940_" > I think there&#x27;s a lot of this dating stuff going on.</a><a name="ts_453100_454940_" > There&#x27;s a lot of expectations that are changing.</a><a name="ts_454940_456980_" > And then there&#x27;s a lot of like distortions.</a><a name="ts_457160_462800_" > So if you look at, I recently saw a paper on incels where their beliefs about what women</a><a name="ts_462800_465460_" > want are quite divorced from reality.</a><a name="ts_465660_470440_" > So there are these ideas that, oh, like, you know, the top 10% of dudes are dating all the</a><a name="ts_470440_470680_" > women.</a><a name="ts_471060_475200_" > So they assume that, okay, like what that means, right, we can sort of like apply the transitive</a><a name="ts_475200_479440_" > property is that this woman I&#x27;m talking to is only interested in a dude who&#x27;s in the</a><a name="ts_479440_480040_" > top 10%.</a><a name="ts_480040_483220_" > But if you actually ask women, like, who are you interested in?</a><a name="ts_483320_484140_" > And who do you date?</a><a name="ts_484300_488300_" > It&#x27;s much more wide and accepting than most men are like understand.</a><a name="ts_488740_492900_" > You know, it&#x27;s interesting because in the same breath, I don&#x27;t disagree with you, but</a><a name="ts_492900_496740_" > I want to kind of push back a little bit because you said it&#x27;s not cute to date someone</a><a name="ts_496740_498260_" > who&#x27;s living at home, whatever, right?</a><a name="ts_498260_499640_" > You&#x27;re like, that&#x27;s sort of a turn off.</a><a name="ts_499860_503740_" > And so that&#x27;s half the male population who&#x27;s living at home with their parents, right?</a><a name="ts_503920_508860_" > And then you want people who make more than you and women are more often graduating college,</a><a name="ts_509000_510680_" > getting higher degrees, getting higher positions.</a><a name="ts_510860_514480_" > And the average salary of a man is $45,000 in the US.</a><a name="ts_515100_519300_" > So it sort of seems like there are, I mean, maybe they&#x27;re not dating the top 10% of men</a><a name="ts_519300_519740_" > only.</a><a name="ts_520080_521420_" > Maybe they&#x27;re just not dating, right?</a><a name="ts_521840_521980_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_522280_523460_" > You know, I think that&#x27;s part of it, too.</a><a name="ts_524060_524800_" > So I&#x27;m curious.</a><a name="ts_524940_525920_" > How is that a pushback?</a><a name="ts_526080_526300_" > No, no.</a><a name="ts_526360_532460_" > So my point is like, so meaning that there is the large majority of men are not finding</a><a name="ts_532460_533000_" > matches.</a><a name="ts_533000_536340_" > It&#x27;s exactly what you said, but they&#x27;re not finding matches because women are choosing not</a><a name="ts_536340_539360_" > to date because their expectations are not being met, which is sort of what you said.</a><a name="ts_539360_543080_" > But it is, I mean, so they&#x27;re not wrong in the sense that this woman wants something different</a><a name="ts_543080_544140_" > than what I have to offer.</a><a name="ts_544320_546800_" > But they&#x27;re wrong in saying they only want the 10% of men.</a><a name="ts_546960_547200_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_547200_548800_" > They just want something different than what I can offer.</a><a name="ts_549020_549180_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_549320_551060_" > So I think that there&#x27;s like both can be true.</a><a name="ts_551180_555380_" > So I think the challenge now is that like, see, we used to need partners.</a><a name="ts_555720_556080_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_556360_563200_" > So now what&#x27;s happened is our society has become so independent that a man is not even competing against</a><a name="ts_563200_563760_" > another man.</a><a name="ts_563900_571310_" > A man has to add value to a woman&#x27;s life more so than the stress or annoyance that he brings.</a><a name="ts_571330_572430_" > And that&#x27;s true for both genders.</a><a name="ts_573210_577410_" > So like, this is what&#x27;s going on is like, now it&#x27;s just easier for me to live by myself</a><a name="ts_577410_578610_" > than it ever used to be.</a><a name="ts_578830_583930_" > And so now we&#x27;re really what, what both genders are competing against is like, is this other</a><a name="ts_583930_586410_" > person&#x27;s life better alone or with me?</a><a name="ts_586570_588470_" > There&#x27;s also other interesting statistics.</a><a name="ts_588470_591430_" > Like if we look at like men under the age of 30 and stuff like that.</a><a name="ts_591570_595310_" > So if you look at like, there&#x27;s also a gender, I mean, sorry, an age gap issue.</a><a name="ts_595310_600190_" > So if you look at women who are 28, if you compare them to like men who are 28, that&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_600190_600950_" > kind of a mismatch.</a><a name="ts_601210_605090_" > But if you look at like, I forget what the statistics are, but there&#x27;s like a interesting</a><a name="ts_605090_607490_" > statistic about people under the age of 30.</a><a name="ts_607490_614070_" > And like, I think maybe like 50 to 70%, I&#x27;m rusty on the statistic of men are not dating</a><a name="ts_614070_618310_" > or don&#x27;t have, aren&#x27;t partnered under the age of 30, but that number is lower for women.</a><a name="ts_618430_620590_" > And the reason for that is because they&#x27;re dating older men.</a><a name="ts_620810_620950_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_621070_621990_" > So it&#x27;s very common.</a><a name="ts_622250_625472_" > So that skews the statistics in some way too.</a><a name="ts_626080_628180_" > So the younger generation is having less sex.</a><a name="ts_628320_629580_" > They&#x27;re less often dating.</a><a name="ts_629840_631900_" > They&#x27;re less often than having children.</a><a name="ts_631960_637600_" > And that leads to the possibility of our, our difficulty in perpetuating our population,</a><a name="ts_637860_640620_" > having a aging population that&#x27;s not replaceable.</a><a name="ts_640780_641000_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_641000_645420_" > I think it&#x27;s important to remember that globally, this is a trend in some places, right?</a><a name="ts_645540_648820_" > So basically developed nations are seeing this way more.</a><a name="ts_649000_651900_" > So I remember talking to a colleague of mine in China.</a><a name="ts_651900_655600_" > And so basically like, you know, China had this one child policy for a while.</a><a name="ts_655740_658770_" > And I heard recently that they have this new policy.</a><a name="ts_658910_662370_" > Well, they, where they will subsidize your third and fourth child.</a><a name="ts_662550_663050_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_663270_669170_" > So what&#x27;s going on in parts of China, in South Korea, in Japan, less so in the U S is exactly</a><a name="ts_669170_672970_" > what you&#x27;re describing, which is that for every, I think we&#x27;re having like the lowest birth rate</a><a name="ts_672970_673870_" > is like 0.67.</a><a name="ts_674230_674490_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_674490_676690_" > So they&#x27;re not even having one to one.</a><a name="ts_676950_677070_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_677170_680470_" > So this is a very scary from an aging population, but there are other parts of the world.</a><a name="ts_680470_684330_" > Like if you look at like South America or areas of like the Middle East or Africa, where</a><a name="ts_684330_686390_" > people are having still lots of kids.</a><a name="ts_686970_690770_" > Um, and so I don&#x27;t, I don&#x27;t think the species is going to die out.</a><a name="ts_690870_694710_" > I think what&#x27;s going to happen is like in developed nations, they&#x27;re going to have this huge problem</a><a name="ts_694710_698150_" > of like, not having enough young people to support the old people.</a><a name="ts_698410_698570_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_698790_699830_" > So that I agree with.</a><a name="ts_699910_701430_" > Was there, I, I, I, sorry, I forgot your question.</a><a name="ts_701430_702290_" > No, no, I think that&#x27;s the issue.</a><a name="ts_702370_705550_" > And so like, my question is like, what can we, like, this is an issue, right?</a><a name="ts_705550_710110_" > This is a, is more societal issue than an individual issue, but it&#x27;s a problem.</a><a name="ts_710130_715130_" > And so what do you think, like, are there things that you think that we should be addressing?</a><a name="ts_715750_716190_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_716310_719230_" > So I, I think that I don&#x27;t focus on societal issues.</a><a name="ts_719350_719910_" > I know it&#x27;s kind of weird.</a><a name="ts_720110_725210_" > So despite the fact that we have this like large scale approach, I still at my heart am</a><a name="ts_725210_725610_" > a clinician.</a><a name="ts_725610_730230_" > So when I work with men who are struggling to date or working with women who are struggling</a><a name="ts_730230_733150_" > to date, what I always focus on is the individual.</a><a name="ts_733410_737430_" > And so I think what we really need to do, like what I would love to do is like make a school</a><a name="ts_737430_738570_" > for crappy boyfriends.</a><a name="ts_739030_742210_" > I don&#x27;t know if I could do that for crappy girlfriends because I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_742210_743670_" > like to be a crappy girlfriend.</a><a name="ts_743850_747190_" > Like, but I think that there&#x27;s a lot of like skills training that we&#x27;re seeing.</a><a name="ts_747330_748810_" > So like, what, what should we intervene in?</a><a name="ts_748890_751090_" > I think social skills atrophy is huge.</a><a name="ts_751090_751450_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_751690_757370_" > So what&#x27;s happening when we start to use technology is like, as you know, any part of</a><a name="ts_757370_760190_" > your brain that you don&#x27;t use like rusts.</a><a name="ts_760490_760650_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_760690_763510_" > So if you don&#x27;t speak a language, you&#x27;ll forget it because your brain is like, hey, we</a><a name="ts_763510_764050_" > don&#x27;t need this.</a><a name="ts_764230_770010_" > So as we move to like text based communication, what started to happen is our empathic search</a><a name="ts_770010_771450_" > circuits have started to atrophy.</a><a name="ts_771610_771890_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_771890_773570_" > So we&#x27;re seeing a rise of social anxiety.</a><a name="ts_773690_774250_" > And why is that?</a><a name="ts_774630_779930_" > That&#x27;s because when I sit with you, I see body language, I see facial expression, I interpret</a><a name="ts_779930_780210_" > it.</a><a name="ts_780210_782390_" > And so this part of my brain works well.</a><a name="ts_782570_786590_" > But now the more that we text, then when we meet in person, I&#x27;m going to feel incredibly</a><a name="ts_786590_786910_" > anxious.</a><a name="ts_787190_790490_" > So we&#x27;re seeing a rise in social anxiety in both genders.</a><a name="ts_790710_794810_" > So that&#x27;s really what I think we need to target is like, how can you be a more emotionally</a><a name="ts_794810_795590_" > available partner?</a><a name="ts_795910_798570_" > How can you be like more confident in yourself?</a><a name="ts_798830_804050_" > We&#x27;re seeing like low self-esteem problems, a lot of shame, you know, and social skills atrophy.</a><a name="ts_804170_807470_" > So these are the things that I kind of focus on and like, how can you, whether you&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_807470_811770_" > a man or a woman, we have everyone in our community, like become just a better human being.</a><a name="ts_812010_812230_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_812250_816270_" > And then I think as you become a better human being, what we tend to see is that the relationship</a><a name="ts_816270_818430_" > kind of like comes pretty naturally.</a><a name="ts_819090_820710_" > But this is not a societal program.</a><a name="ts_820810_821530_" > I&#x27;d love to make it one.</a><a name="ts_821770_825630_" > Well, I think, I think if you did it on an individual level for many, many people at scale,</a><a name="ts_825630_827930_" > it would help society overall, right?</a><a name="ts_828030_829150_" > Like, because I think you&#x27;re right.</a><a name="ts_829570_834390_" > Social skills are definitely less, less robust, right?</a><a name="ts_834550_838850_" > In the, in the age of technology, I worry about how our kids, I mean, I sort of force</a><a name="ts_838850_840950_" > my kids to like communicate with people.</a><a name="ts_841090_842850_" > We go out, like you have to have a conversation.</a><a name="ts_842850_846470_" > You have to learn those skills because otherwise, you know, they&#x27;ll be looking at their phone or</a><a name="ts_846470_849630_" > looking at devices or, I mean, they don&#x27;t have a phone, but like they&#x27;ll be looking at</a><a name="ts_849630_853850_" > some TV or something else or trying to get a dopamine fix through something else.</a><a name="ts_854070_857470_" > And so that is, you know, a real problem.</a><a name="ts_857470_861330_" > I think in society today in our, at least in the developed countries where there&#x27;s lots</a><a name="ts_861330_862210_" > of access to these things.</a><a name="ts_862430_862830_" > Absolutely.</a><a name="ts_862930_866130_" > And I, I think now that I realize it, so, so we have lectures on those topics.</a><a name="ts_866130_870090_" > So even at scale, I know I sort of said I work with individuals, but what I&#x27;ve sort</a><a name="ts_870090_875830_" > of done is like, we did two lectures on communication and relationships, and we have two lectures</a><a name="ts_875830_878870_" > coming up on like how to build meaningful connections.</a><a name="ts_879330_882310_" > And so there&#x27;s a lot of science that we can really utilize.</a><a name="ts_882310_884830_" > And once we understand how connections form.</a><a name="ts_885070_889410_" > So I think like a good example of this is people don&#x27;t realize what leads to attraction.</a><a name="ts_889930_892630_" > So the science of attraction is like really fascinating.</a><a name="ts_892850_899130_" > And the interesting thing is that Tinder does the data points that Tinder collects don&#x27;t correlate</a><a name="ts_899130_900192_" > at all with attraction.</a><a name="ts_900768_904540_" > So your interests and things like that don&#x27;t actually govern attraction in the brain.</a><a name="ts_904540_904660_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_905280_907680_" > So it&#x27;s interesting things like shared emotional experiences.</a><a name="ts_908060_913380_" > So there&#x27;s a super fascinating study where they had people go on first dates on a rickety</a><a name="ts_913380_914860_" > bridge or a stone bridge.</a><a name="ts_915160_917000_" > And on the stone bridge, it&#x27;s stable.</a><a name="ts_917160_918440_" > And it was like, whatever.</a><a name="ts_918720_922800_" > But when you have people meet in the middle of a rickety bridge, your sympathetic nervous</a><a name="ts_922800_923620_" > system is activated.</a><a name="ts_923900_925960_" > Both people are a little bit scared and anxious.</a><a name="ts_926020_930080_" > And when there&#x27;s an, a similar emotional experience, it can even be negative.</a><a name="ts_930848_934010_" > This results in like some kind of bond being formed emotionally.</a><a name="ts_934010_937770_" > So there are some of these things like you have to, you know, keep your date under 75</a><a name="ts_937770_941130_" > minutes because something happens in terms of like attraction and stuff like that.</a><a name="ts_941330_946530_" > There&#x27;s a lot of stuff that we can actually teach people to help them kind of like compensate</a><a name="ts_946530_948010_" > for the social skills atrophy.</a><a name="ts_948250_949030_" > That&#x27;s interesting.</a><a name="ts_949170_950130_" > That&#x27;s really fascinating.</a><a name="ts_950130_950170_" > I think that&#x27;s just fascinating.</a><a name="ts_950170_950390_" > I think that&#x27;s a very fascinating.</a></p></div></body>
