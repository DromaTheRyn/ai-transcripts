Calcium is the backbone of your entire body.</a><a name="ts_16710_21570_S00" > It builds and maintains bones and teeth, but it&#x27;s also behind every heartbeat and muscle contraction.</a><a name="ts_22030_26750_S00" > Your nerves use calcium to send signals, and your blood uses it to clot when you get a cut.</a><a name="ts_26750_31210_S00" > When calcium drops too low, your body steals it from your bones to keep the rest of you running.</a><a name="ts_31690_35950_S00" > That&#x27;s why long-term deficiency can lead to weak bones, brittle nails, and muscle cramps.</a><a name="ts_36130_40030_S00" > Found in dairy, tofu, chia seeds, broccoli, and canned salmon.</a><a name="ts_40190_43490_S00" > It works best with vitamin D, magnesium, and phosphorus.</a><a name="ts_43990_46720_S00" > Without them, calcium can&#x27;t reach your bones properly.</a><a name="ts_47296_47810_S00" > Phosphorus.</a><a name="ts_48310_51170_S00" > Phosphorus teams up with calcium to build your bones and teeth,</a><a name="ts_51370_56330_S00" > but it also powers your entire body through ATP, the molecule that fuels every cell.</a><a name="ts_56330_60350_S00" > Phosphorus builds your DNA, forms the outer wall of your cells,</a><a name="ts_60470_63390_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:00]</span> and activates enzymes that help you process fats and carbs.</a><a name="ts_63630_69090_S00" > When phosphorus levels drop, you can experience muscle weakness, bone pain, fatigue, or confusion.</a><a name="ts_69570_75570_S00" > Deficiency is uncommon, but can appear with chronic alcoholism, starvation, or heavy and tacit use.</a><a name="ts_75770_79510_S00" > Found in salmon, chicken, eggs, Greek yogurt, lentils, and almonds.</a><a name="ts_79730_85310_S00" > In whole foods, phosphorus naturally comes bound to protein, which your body absorbs gradually and safely.</a><a name="ts_85310_92288_S00" > But in processed foods, it&#x27;s added as phosphate additives that absorb too quickly and pull calcium out of bones over time.</a><a name="ts_92864_93510_S00" > Magnesium.</a><a name="ts_94110_96290_S00" > Magnesium is the body&#x27;s quiet power source.</a><a name="ts_96590_102570_S00" > It activates more than 300 enzymes that keep energy flowing, muscles contracting, and your heart beats steady.</a><a name="ts_102930_105410_S00" > Every nerve signal and muscle movement depends on it.</a><a name="ts_105510_109590_S00" > Because magnesium controls how calcium and potassium move in and out of cells.</a><a name="ts_109590_114670_S00" > Long-term deficiency is linked to poor sleep, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance.</a><a name="ts_114850_119050_S00" > Found in pumpkin seeds, almonds, spinach, black beans, and dark chocolate.</a><a name="ts_119210_121550_S00" > Your cells can&#x27;t use energy without magnesium.</a><a name="ts_121810_122656_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:01]</span> Is that essential?</a><a name="ts_123520_124550_S00" > Sodium and potassium.</a><a name="ts_125250_128490_S00" > Sodium and potassium form the body&#x27;s main electrical system.</a><a name="ts_128810_130610_S00" > Sodium stays outside your cells.</a><a name="ts_130810_131970_S00" > Potassium stays inside.</a><a name="ts_132270_135550_S00" > And your cells pump them back and forth thousands of times per second.</a><a name="ts_135550_141430_S00" > Constant swapping creates the electrical charge that keeps your nerves firing, muscles contracting, and heart beating.</a><a name="ts_141770_144830_S00" > Too much sodium or too little potassium can disturb the balance.</a><a name="ts_145130_147970_S00" > This makes your blood pressure rise and puts extra strain on your heart.</a><a name="ts_148250_150750_S00" > Sodium mainly comes from salt and processed foods.</a><a name="ts_150950_154830_S00" > Potassium is richest in bananas, avocados, spinach, and beans.</a><a name="ts_155450_156010_S00" > Chloride.</a><a name="ts_156330_161610_S00" > Chloride is a crucial electrolyte that keeps your body&#x27;s fluids balanced and your acid-base balance steady.</a><a name="ts_161610_164270_S00" > Working right alongside sodium and potassium.</a><a name="ts_164590_167210_S00" > It also helps your stomach make hydrochloric acid.</a><a name="ts_167370_170790_S00" > The strong acid that breaks down food and kills harmful bacteria.</a><a name="ts_171310_173930_S00" > And assists in carrying carbon dioxide out of the body.</a><a name="ts_174090_175770_S00" > Low chloride is pretty rare.</a><a name="ts_176030_179370_S00" > But it can happen after heavy sweating, vomiting, or dehydration.</a><a name="ts_179590_184930_S00" > When levels drop too low, you might experience muscle weakness, neuromuscular issues like twitching,</a><a name="ts_185070_188770_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:05]</span> and even digestion problems since your stomach isn&#x27;t making enough acid.</a><a name="ts_188770_193530_S00" > You&#x27;ll find chloride in table salt, cheese, seaweed, olives, and canned foods.</a><a name="ts_194150_194710_S00" > Sulfur.</a><a name="ts_195170_197690_S00" > Sulfur helps build proteins throughout your body.</a><a name="ts_197870_200850_S00" > It&#x27;s also part of keratin, the protein in your hair and nails,</a><a name="ts_200970_203630_S00" > and collagen, the protein in your skin and joints.</a><a name="ts_204070_206930_S00" > Sulfur inside your cells helps make glutathione.</a><a name="ts_207230_211350_S00" > Your body&#x27;s main antioxidant that supports liver detox and keeps cells healthy.</a><a name="ts_211570_214850_S00" > It also helps make insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar.</a><a name="ts_214850_218550_S00" > Deficiency can appear as brittle hair, weak nails, or fatigue.</a><a name="ts_218850_221210_S00" > Often when overall protein intake is low.</a><a name="ts_221390_222330_S00" > Found in eggs.</a><a name="ts_222490_225290_S00" > Especially yolks, garlic, onions, leeks.</a><a name="ts_225490_227010_S00" > Now let&#x27;s move to the trace minerals.</a><a name="ts_227350_228570_S00" > The ones you may know by name.</a><a name="ts_228630_229950_S00" > But not by what they truly do.</a><a name="ts_230290_231550_S00" > And you need only a trace of them.</a><a name="ts_231710_233280_S00" > Yet, they keep your body running.</a><a name="ts_233824_234240_S00" > Iron.</a><a name="ts_234784_236480_S00" > Iron is what gives your blood its power.</a><a name="ts_236800_237860_S00" > It builds hemoglobin.</a><a name="ts_237940_242440_S00" > The protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from your lungs to every part of your body.</a><a name="ts_242440_246000_S00" > It&#x27;s also part of myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscles.</a><a name="ts_246240_248720_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:06]</span> And several enzymes that help your cells make energy.</a><a name="ts_248940_251660_S00" > When iron runs low, your blood can&#x27;t carry enough oxygen.</a><a name="ts_251940_255360_S00" > Leading to weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and poor focus.</a><a name="ts_255640_258000_S00" > Classic signs of iron deficiency anemia.</a><a name="ts_258180_262180_S00" > Found in red meat, liver, fish, lentils, tofu, and spinach.</a><a name="ts_262900_263392_S00" > Copper.</a><a name="ts_263968_267330_S00" > Copper&#x27;s main job is to keep oxygen and energy flowing in your body.</a><a name="ts_267690_269330_S00" > Without it, iron can&#x27;t do its work.</a><a name="ts_269330_273570_S00" > It also supports enzymes that build connective tissue and protect cells from damage.</a><a name="ts_273770_276090_S00" > Keeping your bones, skin, and blood vessels strong.</a><a name="ts_276530_279010_S00" > Low copper stops your body from using iron properly.</a><a name="ts_279170_281630_S00" > Leading to anemia that doesn&#x27;t improve with iron alone.</a><a name="ts_281810_287310_S00" > Found in oysters, cashews, almonds, sunflower seeds, dark chocolate, and sesame seeds.</a><a name="ts_287910_288350_S00" > Zinc.</a><a name="ts_288530_292490_S00" > Zinc helps your body repair tissues, heal wounds, and fight infections.</a><a name="ts_292950_294310_S00" > It supports your immune system.</a><a name="ts_294530_295430_S00" > Keeps your skin healthy.</a><a name="ts_295630_298370_S00" > And helps make hormones like testosterone and insulin.</a><a name="ts_298370_301790_S00" > It also plays a key role in taste, smell, and growth.</a><a name="ts_302070_305010_S00" > Every cell that grows or repairs itself needs zinc.</a><a name="ts_305290_307130_S00" > It&#x27;s how your body keeps healing and rebuilding.</a><a name="ts_307450_311930_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:07]</span> Low zinc can cause slow wound healing, frequent colds, hair loss, loss of appetite,</a><a name="ts_312110_313610_S00" > or reduced sense of taste and smell.</a><a name="ts_313790_318550_S00" > Find it in foods like oysters, red meat, chicken, eggs, seeds, and legumes.</a><a name="ts_319390_319968_S00" > Iodine.</a><a name="ts_320544_323250_S00" > Iodine&#x27;s main job is to keep your thyroid gland running.</a><a name="ts_323450_325170_S00" > The gland that controls your metabolism.</a><a name="ts_325170_327850_S00" > Meaning how your body turns food into energy.</a><a name="ts_327970_330950_S00" > Without enough iodine, the thyroid can&#x27;t make its hormones.</a><a name="ts_331230_333210_S00" > And your body&#x27;s energy system slows down.</a><a name="ts_333650_336730_S00" > Low iodine causes the thyroid to enlarge into a goiter.</a><a name="ts_337030_340090_S00" > And can lead to fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, and brain fog.</a><a name="ts_340490_344190_S00" > Found in iodized salt, seafood, seaweed, eggs, and dairy.</a><a name="ts_344190_349810_S00" > People who skip salt or eat mostly processed foods, which often use non-iodized salt, are</a><a name="ts_349810_350590_S00" > most at risk.</a><a name="ts_351170_351776_S00" > Selenium.</a><a name="ts_352416_356270_S00" > Selenium protects your cells from damage and is important for thyroid function.</a><a name="ts_356570_360130_S00" > While iodine makes thyroid hormones, selenium activates them.</a><a name="ts_360290_365110_S00" > It&#x27;s part of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that neutralizes harmful molecules</a><a name="ts_365110_366490_S00" > before they can harm your cells.</a><a name="ts_366690_370210_S00" > Low selenium can cause weak immunity or slow thyroid function.</a><a name="ts_370210_373250_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:10]</span> And long-term deficiency may raise the risk of heart problems.</a><a name="ts_373450_377150_S00" > Found in brazil nuts, tuna, chicken, brown rice, and whole grains.</a><a name="ts_378050_378570_S00" > Manganese.</a><a name="ts_379170_383550_S00" > Manganese protects your body&#x27;s energy centers, the mitochondria, from damage,</a><a name="ts_383770_385450_S00" > while helping form healthy bone tissue.</a><a name="ts_385790_389030_S00" > It&#x27;s a key part of an enzyme called superoxide dismutase,</a><a name="ts_389290_392510_S00" > which protects your cells from damage during the energy making process.</a><a name="ts_393030_396990_S00" > Low manganese is rare, but can lead to weak bones or slow healing over time.</a><a name="ts_396990_400910_S00" > found in whole grains, oats, nuts, spinach, and black tea.</a><a name="ts_401470_402030_S00" > Fluoride.</a><a name="ts_402470_404530_S00" > Fluoride&#x27;s main job is to protect your teeth.</a><a name="ts_404870_408030_S00" > It strengthens tooth enamel by forming a tougher mineral layer</a><a name="ts_408030_410850_S00" > that resists acid attacks from food and bacteria.</a><a name="ts_411310_415150_S00" > Low fluoride can lead to weak enamel and higher risk of tooth decay,</a><a name="ts_415350_419150_S00" > while too much can cause white spots on teeth or brittle bones over time.</a><a name="ts_419470_421370_S00" > Commonly found in toothpaste and water.</a><a name="ts_421870_422370_S00" > Chromium.</a><a name="ts_422370_427290_S00" > Chromium helps the insulin hormone work more effectively to move sugar into your cells for energy.</a><a name="ts_427510_430530_S00" > When chromium is low, insulin&#x27;s effectiveness is reduced,</a><a name="ts_430690_432850_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:10]</span> and blood sugar levels can stay higher than normal.</a><a name="ts_433190_436030_S00" > Low chromium may cause fatigue and poor blood sugar control,</a><a name="ts_436230_438630_S00" > especially if you eat a lot of refined carbs.</a><a name="ts_438970_443810_S00" > You can get chromium from black pepper, whole grains, egg yolks, beef, broccoli, and green beans.</a><a name="ts_444550_445070_S00" > Molybdenum.</a><a

process sulfur compounds, alcohol, and drug byproducts,</a><a name="ts_455450_459110_S00" > turning harmful substances into harmless ones your kidneys can flush out.</a><a name="ts_459270_462750_S00" > Without enough molybdenum, these wastes start to build up inside your body.</a><a name="ts_462990_466970_S00" > Found in lentils, black-eyed peas, lima beans, kidney beans, and oats.</a><a name="ts_467150_469390_S00" > Even small amounts meet your daily needs.</a><a name="ts_470050_470530_S00" > Cobalt.</a><a name="ts_470950_476330_S00" > Cobalt&#x27;s main role is inside vitamin B12, where it helps make red blood cells and protect nerve cells.</a><a name="ts_476330_479970_S00" > Your body doesn&#x27;t use cobalt on its own, only as part of B12.</a><a name="ts_480410_482330_S00" > Deficiency is common in strict vegans.</a><a name="ts_482510_486170_S00" > Low B12 can cause venemia, numbness, and memory problems.</a><a name="ts_486390_488490_S00" > Found in meat, fish, eggs, and
