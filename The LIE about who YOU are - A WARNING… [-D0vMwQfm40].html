This stuff just kind of falls out of your head randomly, like leaves off of a tree.</a><a name="ts_31072_39968_" > So people that you know start feeling stranger and stranger and stranger and

developing dementia.</a><a name="ts_81990_83570_" > I swear to God, I&#x27;ve been there.</a><a name="ts_84010_87650_" > I didn&#x27;t know who my wife was for an extended period of time.</a><a name="ts_87810_89930_" > This was 12 months ago.</a><a name="ts_90150_93920_" > Some kind of a story gives us this feeling that we know who we are.</a><a name="ts_94528_100110_" > It&#x27;s understandable that if we struggle with identity, we face a lot of social consequences.</a><a name="ts_100110_101450_" > I&#x27;m going to repeat that again.</a><a name="ts_101670_106430_" > If we struggle with identity, we will always face social consequences.</a><a name="ts_106430_107776_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_107776_109430_" > So we&#x27;re going to talk about identity tonight.</a><a name="ts_109550_112210_" > And we&#x27;re also going to talk about how can we hack it in ourselves?</a><a name="ts_112270_113770_" > How can we hack it in other people?</a><a name="ts_113910_118650_" > And then from a profiling perspective, how am I going to identify someone else&#x27;s identity?</a><a name="ts_118970_120750_" > Who they really are deep down?</a><a name="ts_121010_123770_" > And you can do this in less than a minute and a half.</a><a name="ts_123770_130130_" > And you can identify identity in a deeper level than probably, I would wager, their therapist,</a><a name="ts_130230_134210_" > who they&#x27;ve been working with for a year, would be able to explain.</a><a name="ts_134410_139010_" > We have this guy named Henry Tafiel.</a><a name="ts_139210_141730_" > He invented this thing called social identity theory.</a><a name="ts_141910_148250_" > So this theory just breaks down how we categorize, identify, and compare ourselves to other people.</a><a name="ts_148250_156380_" > So categorization means religion, title, degrees, certifications, awards, nationality, military service.</a><a name="ts_156680_157640_" > And then we have identification.</a><a name="ts_157640_164020_" > So once we categorize the world into groups, then we identify ourselves within those groups.</a><a name="ts_164180_169060_" > And these groups from sexual orientation to religious beliefs, professions.</a><a name="ts_169060_174688_" > We choose our cars, our clothing, our accessories to express our group membership.</a><a name="ts_174688_178336_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_178336_179390_" > And then we get into comparison.</a><a name="ts_179630_183290_" > So comparison makes our identities more obvious.</a><a name="ts_183290_184480_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_184480_190440_" > This is where us versus them tactics and us versus them mentality comes into place.</a><a name="ts_190780_197880_" > One experiment that Dr. Tafiel did is to ask people to compare groups and find out, you know, which group they belong to.</a><a name="ts_197880_204900_" > And people were ten times more likely to give points on a test to people who they thought were in their group.</a><a name="ts_205020_208100_" > This is how Hitler was able to commit crimes.</a><a name="ts_208100_211160_" > So that&#x27;s the basic essence of social identity theory.</a><a name="ts_211320_212920_" > Those three little elements there.</a><a name="ts_212920_215584_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_215584_216760_" > So let&#x27;s talk about these core identities.</a><a name="ts_217000_218820_" > The first one is the historical identity.</a><a name="ts_219020_227060_" > This is rooted in our personal history or in our background, our upbringing, our family heritage, life events that have shaped my journey.</a><a name="ts_227260_228240_" > I&#x27;ve been through this.</a><a name="ts_228240_233472_" > It&#x27;s how a person perceives the past and how it influences their entire life.</a><a name="ts_233472_234592_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_234592_237820_" > Role based is the various roles that we play throughout our lives.</a><a name="ts_237820_238860_" > Like I&#x27;m a CEO.</a><a name="ts_238860_241600_" > I&#x27;m a senior vice president or I&#x27;m a parent.</a><a name="ts_241600_242560_" > I&#x27;m a sibling.</a><a name="ts_242780_243500_" > I&#x27;m a friend.</a><a name="ts_243840_246140_" > So somebody is talking about a role in their life.</a><a name="ts_246440_249080_" > We understand the moment that I hear roles.</a><a name="ts_249280_251460_" > What are the expectations of that person?</a><a name="ts_251620_253060_" > That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re wanting to do.</a><a name="ts_253160_254528_" > That&#x27;s what they want to be seen as.</a><a name="ts_254528_255776_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_255776_260448_" > If I can get them to agree that because of their identity, this decision is a good idea.</a><a name="ts_260448_261664_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_261664_262400_" > I have agreement.</a><a name="ts_262400_263808_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_263808_269450_" > The cognitive dissonance associated with identity is so strong that they&#x27;re not going to deviate from it.</a><a name="ts_269570_277590_" > So if I know how to align a message with their identity, then I can build cognitive dissonance around almost any decision I want to.</a><a name="ts_277590_282340_" > So next is this membership identity.</a><a name="ts_282660_286040_" > This identity is how people see themselves as part of a group.</a><a name="ts_286040_287400_" > It&#x27;s a community thing.</a><a name="ts_287780_290640_" > It&#x27;s a culture thing, organizations, social groups.</a><a name="ts_290860_295820_" > So this is the way that people think and behave based on shared values.</a><a name="ts_296160_310400_" > But anytime I&#x27;m guiding somebody down who has a membership identity, I always want to build the walls of cognitive dissonance around the social expectations of the reputation or the behavior of that group.</a><a name="ts_310400_313740_" > The reputation and behavior of that group is that person&#x27;s identity.</a><a name="ts_313740_316384_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_316384_318580_" > Let&#x27;s just go through a few sample scenarios.</a><a name="ts_318580_319648_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_319648_330870_" > So if I&#x27;m in a business negotiation, for example, I&#x27;m going to engage somebody&#x27;s role based identity role based to establish a lot of respect and understanding.</a><a name="ts_330870_335510_" > I don&#x27;t want historical unless I really need to form a relationship with this person.</a><a name="ts_335690_342630_" > If I&#x27;m a family therapist, I&#x27;m going to focus on historical identity so I can unravel the dynamics of a family.</a><a name="ts_342770_350400_" > If I&#x27;m a leader at a business, I&#x27;m going to leverage member identity to foster some kind of cohesiveness in a little group of people.</a><a name="ts_350400_351424_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_351424_352590_" > How do we leverage that identity?</a><a name="ts_352730_355890_" > The formula is a four step formula that spells out the word idea.</a><a name="ts_356230_359530_" > So step one is identify the dominant identity.</a><a name="ts_359530_366750_" > So I want to pinpoint which types, like historical, role based, or membership, that person&#x27;s expressing most strongly.</a><a name="ts_366970_369530_" > I want to listen for linguistic indicators.</a><a name="ts_370290_372030_" > I want to observe emotional emphasis.</a><a name="ts_372030_373630_" > Are they referencing their past?</a><a name="ts_373730_375870_" > Are they talking about their role, highlighting a group?</a><a name="ts_376250_378210_" > So the D in idea is deepen.</a><a name="ts_378210_381088_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_381088_383320_" > We&#x27;re going to affirm the importance of their identity.</a><a name="ts_383320_386660_" > So we&#x27;re reflecting their language a little bit, their tone.</a><a name="ts_387480_391300_" > But we really want to let them know that we think their identity is very important.</a><a name="ts_391300_397380_" > So we want to say something like, you know, I think it&#x27;s truly incredible how much pride you take in your heritage.</a><a name="ts_397680_404170_" > I think that dedication to blank is really rare and super admirable.</a><a name="ts_404250_407610_" > And then we align with that, so we&#x27;re feeding that need.</a><a name="ts_407810_411930_" > We&#x27;re feeding that identity and making that identity important and validated.</a><a name="ts_411930_415330_" > So the E of idea is empower.</a><a name="ts_415770_421270_" > So we&#x27;re highlighting how their past strengths and experiences are relevant to right now.</a><a name="ts_421410_427190_" > So we might say something like, you know, you&#x27;ve overcome so much in the past in this challenge.</a><a name="ts_427190_431150_" > I think it&#x27;s just another opportunity to really prove your resilience.</a><a name="ts_431150_440230_" > And if it&#x27;s a membership identity person, I might say something like, this is a decision that I think is going to make a huge difference for the community.</a><a name="ts_440230_443170_" > And I know how committed you are to their success.</a><a name="ts_443230_445130_" > So I&#x27;m pulling out identity.</a><a name="ts_445150_454060_" > I&#x27;m putting the identity up here and I&#x27;m saying here, let&#x27;s make this decision because look what you just agreed to right here.</a><a name="ts_454060_458592_" > So the A of idea is aligned.</a><a name="ts_459520_464160_" > One way that I used to do this, I don&#x27;t do it very often anymore, is I&#x27;ll tell a story.</a><a name="ts_464180_472100_" > If it&#x27;s historical, I&#x27;ll say something like, all these people have seen experiences like yours just lead to remarkable clarity in similar situations.</a><a name="ts_472480_482760_" > If it&#x27;s role based, I&#x27;ll say, you know, I think everybody knows the best managers that people can work with always find that small, decisive action always has the biggest impact.</a><a name="ts_482760_484672_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_484672_493130_" > Membership, I&#x27;ll say, you know, groups like this tend to follow the quiet confidence of somebody who is truly invested in the future.</a><a name="ts_493350_495670_" > I&#x27;m identifying this dominant identity.</a><a name="ts_495890_497830_" > So historical role based membership.</a><a name="ts_498230_505010_" > I&#x27;m deepening that connection, kind of bringing it more into the light and showing them that I know who you are and it&#x27;s it&#x27;s awesome.</a><a name="ts_505170_505632_" > It&#x27;s great.</a><a name="ts_506208_507360_" > Then I&#x27;m empowering it.</a><a name="ts_507936_511300_" > I&#x27;m framing their action as a way to express that.</a><a name="ts_511300_516370_" > So doing this with me is a perfect way to express that identity.</a><a name="ts_516630_521600_" > It&#x27;s a natural expression of who you are as a person and then aligning.</a><a name="ts_522400_526368_" > I&#x27;m aligning the request with their future vision of themselves or their group.</a><a name="ts_526368_533814_" > (.......)</a><a name="ts_533814_526368_" > And the other person and then tell your story is an abstract example, you know, who you are.</a><a name="ts_526368_533814_" > (.......)</a><a name="ts_533814_526368_" > But I think, as far as all this of the people who you say, I think the ability to do just theจ Ishiya,</a><a name="ts_526368_533814_" > (.......)</a><a
