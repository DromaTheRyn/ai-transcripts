that&#x27;s saying we&#x27;re as sick as our secrets.</a><a name="ts_4050_4750_" > That&#x27;s true.</a><a name="ts_4750_10784_" > If you&#x27;re harboring some shameful thing, it&#x27;s gonna manifest in some way.</a><a name="ts_11360_10784_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_11650_12640_" > It has to.</a><a name="ts_12640_13856_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_13856_14410_" > It does.</a><a name="ts_14570_26970_" > It comes out and it can look like anxiety, panic, depression, victim mindset, anger, withdrawal.</a><a name="ts_27410_28090_" > What else, Sarah?</a><a name="ts_28350_28890_" > Self-harm.</a><a name="ts_29350_30370_" > Self-harm.</a><a name="ts_30510_30710_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_30830_31550_" > Self-harm.</a><a name="ts_31790_32530_" > Substance use.</a><a name="ts_33050_34530_" > Substance use is big.</a><a name="ts_35150_35330_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_35770_36710_" > Self-sabotage.</a><a name="ts_37650_40450_" > Emotional, not being able to manage your emotions.</a><a name="ts_40850_46870_" > I mean, emotional dysregulation because you have to always be out of your body.</a><a name="ts_47030_54410_" > When you can&#x27;t tolerate what you&#x27;re feeling or something from your past, you have to escape it in some way.</a><a name="ts_54410_62752_" > (........)</a><a name="ts_62752_54624_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_54624_63040_" > (........)</a><a name="ts_63040_67620_" > So, Sarah, I am so excited to talk about this because I&#x27;ve been thinking about this quite a bit.</a><a name="ts_67620_72032_" > And I do love the idea of self-compassion.</a><a name="ts_72640_81910_" > I feel like self-forgiveness can be an important step at an area that I see that does not receive enough emphasis.</a><a name="ts_82390_94050_" > And this matters to me because I see it as, like, one of the most healing things you can do is this practice of actually making amends, of actually, when you&#x27;ve done something wrong, actually fixing it.</a><a name="ts_94050_95110_" > So let me, let me give you an example.</a><a name="ts_95390_101730_" > I follow this psychologist who&#x27;s a writer and he&#x27;s great, like, almost everything he writes, I&#x27;m like, that&#x27;s so helpful, that&#x27;s so cool.</a><a name="ts_102170_120570_" > One of his followers wrote into him and was like, hey, back in the day, I cheated and it was like a certificate exam, like, it was a really important exam, not like the bar exam, but maybe he was a pharmacist or some other thing that he had to do and he cheated on his exam.</a><a name="ts_120570_126670_" > Oh, and maybe it&#x27;s been five or ten years now, and he says, I still feel bothered by this.</a><a name="ts_126850_130400_" > It&#x27;s come, it&#x27;s gonna, see, what I talk about also is how it manifests.</a><a name="ts_131040_130400_" > Go ahead.</a><a name="ts_130400_131470_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_131470_138050_" > So let me, so, so this psychologist who I respect and admire, his advice was, you need to work on self-forgiveness.</a><a name="ts_138050_138690_" > No.</a><a name="ts_139584_140500_" > That was my thought, too.</a><a name="ts_140860_141540_" > That was my thought, too.</a><a name="ts_141540_141760_" > That was my thought, too.</a><a name="ts_142080_142440_" > He&#x27;s never gonna have freedom.</a><a name="ts_142760_144000_" > He&#x27;s never gonna have freedom.</a><a name="ts_144608_150150_" > Because he&#x27;s always gonna know that he has not fixed what he did wrong.</a><a name="ts_150590_150710_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_150710_164050_" > So would you say, I think you are more of an expert on this because AA does have a, the 12-step process does have a practice of making amends and fixing things, but I feel like most modern psychology is so, like, just like, you should try to feel good.</a><a name="ts_164050_169830_" > And I&#x27;m like, no, you should, you should actually do good works, and then you&#x27;ll feel good.</a><a name="ts_169970_178050_" > So my advice to this person would have been, okay, you harmed, or you, you harmed other people, and you betrayed yourself.</a><a name="ts_178050_180050_" > You know that you lied.</a><a name="ts_180290_182112_" > So now we fix it.</a><a name="ts_182752_192210_" > And my advice would be, you have the choice, if you want to heal this, of going back to your licensing board and telling them, I&#x27;m gonna redo my exams.</a><a name="ts_192210_196650_" > And making repairs, like making actual repairs.</a><a name="ts_197130_203990_" > Because what I would hypothesize is in that guy&#x27;s life, it&#x27;s manifesting in a bunch of ways.</a><a name="ts_204310_205330_" > That&#x27;s what happens.</a><a name="ts_205850_206970_" > Yeah, he&#x27;s anxious.</a><a name="ts_206970_207730_" > He&#x27;s depressed.</a><a name="ts_207730_208830_" > He&#x27;s suicidal.</a><a name="ts_208850_210830_" > He has crappy relationships.</a><a name="ts_210830_212130_" > He can&#x27;t be himself.</a><a name="ts_212130_213430_" > He has secrets.</a><a name="ts_213590_214550_" > He has substance abuse.</a><a name="ts_214770_220800_" > You cannot live with that kind of guilt and shame and not have it come out somewhere.</a><a name="ts_220800_222500_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_222500_227780_" > This is the thing that I feel, and I&#x27;ve been very hesitant to speak to it, which is one of the reasons I brought you on.</a><a name="ts_227860_230240_" > Because I&#x27;m like, I think Sarah probably has a lot of experience in this area.</a><a name="ts_230340_234620_" > But when we, when we do something that goes against our sense of what is right.</a><a name="ts_234620_240660_" > So let&#x27;s say I lie, or I like, let&#x27;s imagine I, I mean, I have done this.</a><a name="ts_240920_248860_" > I, when I worked at a pizza place, the rule and the policy that I had signed when I worked there was that you pay 50% for your food.</a><a name="ts_249140_249360_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_249560_252880_" > And then sometimes we&#x27;d have a manager who would just give it to us.</a><a name="ts_252880_260700_" > Or sometimes we would just like everyone else would just take the food, go in the back room, eat it quietly, and then move on.</a><a name="ts_261040_267060_" > And at some point, I was asked in a different job interview, do you ever steal from your employer?</a><a name="ts_267300_268192_" > Yes or no.</a><a name="ts_268192_270080_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_270080_275560_" > And in that moment, I was confronted with the reality that I was stealing from my employer.</a><a name="ts_275560_276200_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_276540_276980_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_277100_284980_" > And in that moment, when we&#x27;re stealing from our employer, or when we&#x27;re lying, or when we&#x27;re, when we&#x27;re betraying our deepest sense of what is right and wrong.</a><a name="ts_284980_286240_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_286240_290070_" > If we continue to do it, we have to cover it up somehow.</a><a name="ts_290290_290590_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_290850_295210_" > We have to cover it up with blame, like, oh, well, my employer doesn&#x27;t pay me enough.</a><a name="ts_295510_297110_" > So I deserve to do this.</a><a name="ts_297450_301670_" > Or anger, like, oh, well, he like, you know, he deserves it.</a><a name="ts_301910_302910_" > Or shame.</a><a name="ts_303010_305150_" > Well, I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m just a bad person anyway.</a><a name="ts_305150_309230_" > Yeah, I&#x27;ll never, like, really deserve more than this.</a><a name="ts_309390_311530_" > And then we don&#x27;t trust other people either.</a><a name="ts_312416_311776_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_312416_314570_" > We assume other people are going to be bad.</a><a name="ts_314630_321130_" > We have to, we have to justify all of the things that we&#x27;ve done wrong.</a><a name="ts_321710_325050_" > In some way, we have to make some fake math.</a><a name="ts_325330_325570_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_325870_326490_" > To make it okay.</a><a name="ts_326870_330070_" > And then that fake math sticks with us in all our relationships.</a><a name="ts_330070_331410_" > It shows up later.</a><a name="ts_331830_332990_" > Okay, I&#x27;m talking a lot.</a><a name="ts_333070_333470_" > What do you think?</a><a name="ts_333570_335050_" > No, but that&#x27;s the human condition.</a><a name="ts_335050_338030_" > I mean, we talk about that on my little YouTube channel a lot.</a><a name="ts_338170_340170_" > That substance abuse is the same way.</a><a name="ts_340370_345210_" > I mean, the whole, the quintessential component of substance abuse is denial, rationalization,</a><a name="ts_345390_345990_" > minimization.</a><a name="ts_346270_347710_" > And then you get sober.</a><a name="ts_347890_353210_" > And what you realize is just because you get sober, all the, all the behaviors are still</a><a name="ts_353210_353570_" > there.</a><a name="ts_353570_358530_" > So you&#x27;re going to now have to rationalize and minimize everything else because we want</a><a name="ts_358530_359730_" > to feel okay.</a><a name="ts_360576_359968_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_360940_363552_" > And yet it&#x27;s about clearing it up.</a><a name="ts_364352_365980_" > You know, I was thinking of this.</a><a name="ts_366220_367380_" > Let me just pause for a second.</a><a name="ts_367600_369700_" > I want to make this point really clear.</a><a name="ts_369700_370220_" > Go.</a><a name="ts_370420_374600_" > When you have harmed someone else or you&#x27;ve gone against your deepest sense of what is</a><a name="ts_374600_374920_" > right.</a><a name="ts_375280_375440_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_375680_385810_" > You have a choice in that moment to go back and make repairs or to twist reality.</a><a name="ts_386350_386770_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_386770_393410_" > And twisting reality looks like minimizing what you did wrong, maximizing what other</a><a name="ts_393410_397890_" > people did wrong or the, or the opposite, which is like, fine, I&#x27;m just a terrible person.</a><a name="ts_398290_399170_" > Creating labels.</a><a name="ts_399170_404910_" > And I would say in my religious tradition, I was taught frequently that when you&#x27;ve done</a><a name="ts_404910_410450_" > something wrong, you go, uh, confess and, and make repairs and not just like to a priest,</a><a name="ts_410510_414850_" > like you, you go tell the person what you did wrong and then you try to make it right.</a><a name="ts_415230_415510_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_415650_417950_" > And you try to learn from it and come back to it.</a><a name="ts_418010_423350_" > So with this pizza example, when I realized when it really hit my heart, oh, I&#x27;ve been stealing.</a><a name="ts_423350_424930_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_424930_431270_" > I ended up going to my manager, going to his office and being like, Hey, Jim, I&#x27;ve been</a><a name="ts_432170_435910_" > eating food without paying for it for like a year.</a><a name="ts_436030_437950_" > And I was like crying cause I cry easily.</a><a name="ts_438110_440140_" > And he was like, Oh, okay.</a><a name="ts_440300_441300_" > Emma, thanks for telling me.</a><a name="ts_441500_445080_" > Feel free to write me a check and pay me back for what you&#x27;ve eaten.</a><a name="ts_445984_447040_" > So then I did.</a><a name="ts_447040_448096_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_448096_449260_" > And then my heart was clear.</a><a name="ts_449820_450220_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_450220_451520_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_451520_452128_" > And I was done.</a><a name="ts_453120_457260_" > There are different kinds of amends like financial amends is one category.</a><a name="ts_457940_458380_" > Absolutely.</a><a name="ts_458920_459800_" > And you&#x27;re right.</a><a name="ts_460020_463480_" > It&#x27;s all about also changing behavior and learning from it.</a><a name="ts_464100_464720_" > Do you know what I mean?</a><a name="ts_465320_470920_" > Like that&#x27;s something we can&#x27;t amend for, but we can at least be honest about and then try</a><a name="ts_470920_475740_" > to like learn from it and try to embody something differently in the future.</a><a name="ts_475860_476740_" > And that is making amends.</a><a name="ts_476880_481200_" > We can, I want, I want to save like different ways to make amends for the, like further down</a><a name="ts_481200_482220_" > the road in this conversation.</a><a name="ts_482320_483940_" > Cause there are so many ways to make amends.</a><a name="ts_484120_484480_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_484660_485540_" > The end is all.</a><a name="ts_485540_485740_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_485740_487280_" > I have different kinds of amends.</a><a name="ts_487440_488240_" > I have examples.</a><a name="ts_488600_491800_" > I have things to not do with amends.</a><a name="ts_492020_498220_" > I have how to set it up, but it&#x27;s really, you&#x27;re right about what it causes you, how it</a><a name="ts_498220_501960_" > affects you, how we deal with it in our present life.</a><a name="ts_502140_505160_" > Like if we don&#x27;t want to own it, it comes out.</a><a name="ts_505160_510460_" > This is alcoholics where I first learned this, but the guy that first were built up.</a><a name="ts_510460_513120_" > You got it was a guy who was a Christian minister.</a><a name="ts_513260_517300_" > It was called the Oxford group back in the early 1900s.</a><a name="ts_517380_524400_" > And the guy that started it was a minister who got really angry with a bunch of people, left</a><a name="ts_524400_531640_" > his ministry and then realized, oh my God, I&#x27;m not going to be free unless I make amends to these people.</a><a name="ts_531640_537888_" > And I know it&#x27;s in a lot of religions, but you know, Bill W got the idea from that.</a><a name="ts_538496_539570_" > The guy that started AA.</a><a name="ts_539910_544650_" > And I think with alcoholics, you know, it&#x27;s so obvious that we&#x27;ve done some stuff wrong.</a><a name="ts_544850_547090_" > But all human beings do stuff wrong.</a><a name="ts_547090_551230_" > It&#x27;s not just alcoholics and I was going to take it out of that frame also.</a><a name="ts_551650_552010_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_552170_558270_" > And the other thing is this idea that people are so much more comfortable with being a victim.</a><a name="ts_558490_559310_" > I&#x27;ve been a victim.</a><a name="ts_559470_560610_" > I&#x27;ve had sexual assaults.</a><a name="ts_560710_565490_" > I&#x27;ve had different things happen to me, but it doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s not the both.</a><a name="ts_565570_568490_" > And we can be a victim and do bad things.</a><a name="ts_568630_569330_" > It&#x27;s all.</a><a name="ts_569510_569790_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_569790_576870_" > And, you know, there are amends to certain people that have done us wrong, but we&#x27;ve also done wrong.</a><a name="ts_577010_578510_" > Like I think of divorces.</a><a name="ts_578930_586130_" > So many people get so stuck with staying angry at their spouse when they&#x27;ve been angry for 20.</a><a name="ts_586250_589070_" > You know, they&#x27;ve been married for 20 years and done a lot of stuff.</a><a name="ts_589070_589130_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_589350_597370_" > So it&#x27;s about what the big book says, putting the person in the category of the spiritually sick and looking at your own behavior.</a><a name="ts_597890_604064_" > Even if someone has done stuff to you, you still have to own your part to be free.</a><a name="ts_604672_605390_" > Do you know what I mean?</a><a name="ts_605730_609510_" > So it&#x27;s not just about things you&#x27;ve done to innocent people.</a><a name="ts_609510_618130_" > It&#x27;s actually the hardest ones are ones where we rationalize and blame others and yet don&#x27;t look at our part in the relationship.</a><a name="ts_618130_629810_" > And I do, I do want to, I do want to acknowledge like when we, when we, when we veer off the path, when we&#x27;ve done wrong and it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s normal that we all do wrong.</a><a name="ts_629970_630210_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_630210_631050_" > This is normal.</a><a name="ts_631410_631890_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_632130_635830_" > Like it&#x27;s natural, normal and human to make mistakes.</a><a name="ts_636130_636410_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_636750_637170_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_637990_640450_" > The question is next, what will we do with it?</a><a name="ts_640670_641030_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_641030_652270_" > And if we hide or rationalize it, we deepen our sense of shame and distance ourselves from others.</a><a name="ts_652930_655030_" > And there&#x27;s, there&#x27;s two big ways we do this.</a><a name="ts_655150_661510_" > And, and the first big way is to believe that we&#x27;re the one who&#x27;s good and everyone else is bad.</a><a name="ts_661910_662240_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_662784_664610_" > And this is a form of self justification.</a><a name="ts_665270_670030_" > Well, my ex was so terrible that the little things I did weren&#x27;t bad anymore.</a><a

we&#x27;ve taken the steps to make repairs.</a><a name="ts_790150_790570_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_790570_795990_" > Then we have to truthfully and honestly treat ourselves with love and

there&#x27;s so much that comes out of it.</a><a name="ts_861020_867600_" > liberation, you know, more intimacy with people, better relationships, more sense of peace.</a><a name="ts_867600_874200_" >

and a lot of people in AA get to this part and they stop because it&#x27;s too hard.</a><a name="ts_912704_915790_" > I&#x27;ve had people relapse when they get to a mess.</a><a name="ts_916090_918550_" > So why is it so hard?</a><a name="ts_918770_925490_" > And I think because it activates the shame and the guilt and the incident or whatever happened.</a><a name="ts_925750_930750_" > And it&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re getting it out of your body and looking at it.</a><a name="ts_930750_935030_" > And it&#x27;s just, oh, it&#x27;s easier to, you know, blame others.</a><a name="ts_935410_938090_" > And that&#x27;s where the self compassion comes in.</a><a name="ts_938270_941970_" > I have to have compassion for myself that I stole my mother&#x27;s

name="ts_955170_955550_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_955550_956704_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_956704_959610_" > I think it is immensely liberating.</a><a name="ts_959610_967760_" > But because the rationalization, yes, numbed your emotions a little bit, actually facing</a><a name="ts_967760_969800_" > making an honest, what is it called?</a><a name="ts_969900_970480_" > Honest accountability.</a><a name="ts_970880_973480_" > What&#x27;s that step where you write down all the bad things you did?</a><a name="ts_973960_975320_" > Oh, the moral inventory.</a><a

name="ts_986020_991160_" > So when I, when I saw that, that survey and it said, do you steal from your employers?</a><a name="ts_991160_992940_" > And I had to answer yes or no.</a><a name="ts_993400_995760_" > That increased my sense of anxiety.</a><a name="ts_996200_996440_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_996440_997856_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_997856_1001950_" > And then I had the choice

name="ts_1011470_1011590_" > But vitality.</a><a name="ts_1011930_1016570_" > It&#x27;s like when you tell a secret to someone, like all of a sudden all this energy is released.</a><a name="ts_1016830_1017830_" > So you&#x27;re right.</a><a name="ts_1017830_1022510_" > I always talk about short term pain for long term relief.</a><a name="ts_1022910_1028370_" > It&#x27;s like to be uncomfortable for a temporary little moment to be free.</a><a name="ts_1029310_1036040_" > So on, on a practical level, how does someone do it?</a><a name="ts_1036200_1040940_" > They, they know, or maybe they don&#x27;t know that they&#x27;ve harmed someone.</a><a name="ts_1041240_1041560_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1041580_1043520_" > That they&#x27;ve done something wrong in their past.</a><a name="ts_1043640_1044560_" > We all have.</a><a name="ts_1044560_1045344_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1045344_1046624_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1046624_1051060_" > How does someone start to do it on a practical level?</a><a name="ts_1051300_1051580_" > All right.</a><a name="ts_1051620_1057030_" > On a practical level, I think when you sit quietly, it&#x27;s already right there.</a><a name="ts_1057270_1058430_" > It&#x27;s right underneath the surface.</a><a name="ts_1058430_1063450_" > If you can access it, if you&#x27;re not acting out, if you&#x27;re not substance abusing or coping</a><a name="ts_1063450_1066730_" > in a bunch of ways, but some stuff will come up.</a><a name="ts_1066890_1072310_" > So you make a list of names or, or, you know, a pizza place.</a><a name="ts_1072310_1077590_" > You know, I actually had to make amends to a place that I stole stuff from when I was</a><a name="ts_1077590_1081650_" > a drug addict and the store was gone now.</a><a name="ts_1081810_1085710_" > But I, what you do is you do something to balance out the karma.</a><a name="ts_1085950_1088610_" > So it was a, it was a tool house.</a><a name="ts_1088610_1090090_" > It was like a garden shop.</a><a name="ts_1090190_1095890_" > So I ended up donating money to a place in my town that they were starting a community garden.</a><a name="ts_1095890_1101290_" > So it&#x27;s like, even if things like grave grave side amends is another one.</a><a name="ts_1101370_1104010_" > I made it a very powerful grave side of men to my mother.</a><a name="ts_1104170_1110112_" > So you start with a list of names, maybe just the top three we can say to people.</a><a name="ts_1110688_1114570_" > If you write out specifically, there&#x27;s like, there&#x27;s tools.</a><a name="ts_1114630_1116950_" > You want to be as specific as possible.</a><a name="ts_1117310_1121170_" > You don&#x27;t want to say, I&#x27;m really sorry.</a><a

better.</a><a name="ts_1129790_1135170_" > You just stick with what specifically you&#x27;re making, making the amend for.</a><a name="ts_1135170_1142370_" > The other warning is if you&#x27;re still

name="ts_1152030_1155310_" > You have to be ready and willing to really do it.</a><a name="ts_1155630_1161890_" > And so, you know, we have this, this thing where you make three columns and you do the

ones.</a><a name="ts_1165710_1169370_" > Then you do the ones that harder, but I want freedom.</a><a name="ts_1169610_1172928_" > And then you do the ones that like, I&#x27;m never going to do.</a><a

over to the easy list because the more work you do on yourself,</a><a name="ts_1184330_1185330_" > the more freedom you want.</a><a name="ts_1185450_1188210_" > And that amend with him was incredibly powerful.</a><a name="ts_1188870_1189210_" > Wow.</a><a name="ts_1189210_1190390_" > And we have a great relationship.</a><a name="ts_1190730_1191650_" > What was that like?</a><a

step.</a><a name="ts_1340270_1343010_" > The first step is we&#x27;re powerless over alcohol.</a><a name="ts_1343190_1344310_" > Our lives became a man job.</a><a name="ts_1344710_1348110_" > But again, there are so many zillions of 12 step programs.</a><a name="ts_1348110_1351290_" > It could be I&#x27;m powerless over my husband.</a><a name="ts_1351490_1352490_" > I&#x27;m powerless over my

the care of God as I understood him.</a><a name="ts_1378170_1379550_" > Four is the moral inventory.</a><a name="ts_1379550_1384920_" > Now, the inventory, it&#x27;s resentments, fears and sex.</a><a name="ts_1385888_1388950_" > So it&#x27;s all our anger and our resentments.</a><a name="ts_1389350_1392670_" > It&#x27;s the fear, which is really underneath resentment.</a><a name="ts_1392670_1394550_" > And then it&#x27;s our sexual history.</a><a name="ts_1394690_1399590_" > And I&#x27;ve done sexual histories with people that have had sex with one person or 100 people.</a><a name="ts_1399770_1402670_" > So it&#x27;s not really about the people.</a><a name="ts_1402670_1408210_" > It&#x27;s about what we&#x27;re carrying because a lot of shame, a lot of shame in the sexual inventory.</a><a name="ts_1408210_1411330_" > So then we do the fifth step, which is I tell another person.</a><a name="ts_1411490_1412290_" > I tell my sponsor.</a><a name="ts_1412490_1413530_" > I read it to them.</a><a name="ts_1413530_1414790_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1414790_1415570_" > Six and seven.</a><a name="ts_1415770_1418070_" > I ask God to remove my

name="ts_1429810_1436710_" > So you do a nightly check in where if I, like my sponsor this morning, yelled at this coffee</a><a name="ts_1436710_1439630_" > girl yesterday, what am I going to do today to clear that up?</a><a name="ts_1439710_1441810_" > Am I going to drive back there to say, I&#x27;m sorry, whatever.</a><a name="ts_1442370_1449680_" > So the idea of the tab is so you don&#x27;t accumulate, you know, 500 more resentments.</a><a name="ts_1449680_1449700_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1450080_1452940_" > This is what I think is so freeing about it.</a><a name="ts_1453040_1459020_" > Because if we imagine, like, when I harm someone else and I don&#x27;t make amends, it&#x27;s like a brick</a><a name="ts_1459020_1460040_" > in my backpack.</a><a name="ts_1460500_1460820_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1461040_1467140_" > And if I do this for 20 years where I&#x27;m just getting angrier and more defensive and more isolated</a><a name="ts_1467140_1472000_" > upset at people or more victimy or more like I&#x27;m such a bad person, my backpack gets very</a><a name="ts_1472000_1472380_" > heavy.</a><a name="ts_1472660_1472800_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1473000_1476920_" > And you could do, you could do one big step to lay down that backpack, but we each pick</a><a name="ts_1476920_1478000_" > up bricks each day.</a><a name="ts_1478300_1478560_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1478660_1482760_" > And having a practice to set those bricks down each day is powerful.</a><a name="ts_1482760_1488400_" > And this is where my, my personal spiritual and religious practice comes in is that we do</a><a name="ts_1488400_1490720_" > a, you know, a nightly prayer and we are grateful.</a><a name="ts_1491160_1491280_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1491280_1495980_" > And we express, we, we look at, like, we consider our day and we think, how did it go?</a><a name="ts_1495980_1498480_" > Is there someone I need to, something I need to fix?</a><a name="ts_1498680_1498720_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1498720_1501220_" > And then you ask for help to do better the next day.</a><a name="ts_1501780_1508000_" > And then each Sunday we do, we do like a bigger ordinance around clearing, clearing that queue,</a><a name="ts_1508340_1509320_" > clearing that backpack.</a><a name="ts_1509860_1510000_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1510000_1511320_" > And that&#x27;s what my religion is.</a><a name="ts_1511440_1513780_" > Like, my religion is like, can I clear my heart off?</a><a name="ts_1513880_1514880_" > Can I serve people?</a><a name="ts_1515060_1515680_" > Yes.</a><a

that.</a><a name="ts_1527310_1534650_" > But I feel like in general, psychology in general has ignored this freedom giving step.</a><a name="ts_1535130_1535490_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1535490_1535840_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1536384_1537690_" > So like someone might feel really angry.</a><a name="ts_1537770_1539330_" > Like you felt really angry at your ex-husband.</a><a name="ts_1539410_1539590_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1539710_1541850_" > And you probably thought it was because of everything he did to you.</a><a name="ts_1542010_1544190_" > But it&#x27;s, and that may be true too.</a><a name="ts_1544430_1545530_" > That also might be true.</a><a name="ts_1545530_1546270_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1546270_1552640_" > And when we have harmed someone else, anger is an amazing way to rationalize.</a><a name="ts_1553380_1553824_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1554816_1553824_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_1554816_1557210_" > And so we carry that anger on purpose as a shield.</a><a name="ts_1557530_1558470_" > Oh, absolutely.</a><a name="ts_1558730_1558930_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1559050_1563410_" > When we make repairs, we don&#x27;t need to carry that anger.</a><a name="ts_1563890_1565990_" > Because we don&#x27;t need to defend ourselves so much anymore.</a><a name="ts_1566130_1566310_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1566450_1569770_" > So we could spend all day

Or you stole something and you need to pay it back.</a><a name="ts_1577710_1578110_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1578350_1581310_" > Or you hurt someone and you need to pay for their medical bills or

have gone to jail.</a><a name="ts_1587936_1587392_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1587936_1592940_" > So I mean, it&#x27;s really about you&#x27;re only going to get the freedom if you balance the

yeah.</a><a name="ts_1980810_1984610_" > Did you know, like, English soccer players, if there was a black guy on the team,</a><a name="ts_1984710_1987130_" > the other team would throw bananas at them.</a><a name="ts_1987730_1989370_" > Like, this is a real issue.</a><a name="ts_1989470_1991590_" > There&#x27;s a good chance to, like, teach and learn.</a><a name="ts_1991890_1995790_" > And instead, they just kind of teased and withdrew.</a><a name="ts_1996590_1998370_" > And that&#x27;s how the situation was managed.</a><a name="ts_1998490_2001490_" > It&#x27;s like, this could have been such a cool chance of, like, healing.</a><a name="ts_2001490_2002530_" > You know?</a><a name="ts_2002850_2004270_" > And it&#x27;s not even managed.</a><a name="ts_2004490_2005130_" > That&#x27;s the thing.</a><a name="ts_2005450_2006570_" > Like, they think it&#x27;s managed.</a><a name="ts_2006570_2008064_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2008064_2008450_" > It&#x27;s not.</a><a name="ts_2008570_2013170_" > And this is what&#x27;s interesting to me is that I think most people don&#x27;t have the education,</a><a name="ts_2013370_2017370_" > the skills, the opportunities to learn how freeing this can be.</a><a name="ts_2017790_2018230_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2018230_2019488_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2019488_2019700_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_2019840_2022840_" > So how, on a

more harm.</a><a name="ts_2032420_2032540_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_2032720_2034300_" > There&#x27;s different debates about this.</a><a name="ts_2034420_2039920_" > I was going to say, if you&#x27;ve been having an affair on your wife, you don&#x27;t just go to your wife and say,</a><a name="ts_2040260_2041820_" > Honey, I&#x27;ve been having an affair.</a><a name="ts_2042460_2044640_" > And, you know, everything&#x27;s fine.</a><a name="ts_2045020_2051180_" > So you don&#x27;t just blurt out something if it&#x27;s going to really harm the other person.</a><a name="ts_2051560_2055420_" > How it&#x27;s done is you want to see the person live, if possible.</a><a name="ts_2055420_2057460_" > Of course, you can write a letter and all that.</a><a name="ts_2057600_2062300_" > But if you can get together with the person live, you say, I&#x27;d really like to clear something up with you.</a><a name="ts_2062700_2064780_" > Can you give me some time to get together?</a><a name="ts_2065040_2067940_" > You know, in AA, they say, I&#x27;ve been going through this process.</a><a name="ts_2068140_2070640_" > They kind of explain it because people seem surprised.</a><a name="ts_2071100_2078400_" > But when you get together with the person, you just say, I just really have been burdened by this thing I did.</a><a name="ts_2078480_2080180_" > And I want to make amends to you.</a><a name="ts_2080180_2085260_" > I want to say I&#x27;m really sorry for X, Y and Z.

name="ts_2088860_2090860_" > You don&#x27;t ask for forgiveness.</a><a name="ts_2091220_2091980_" > That&#x27;s the other thing.</a><a name="ts_2092120_2095460_" > You can&#x27;t expect forgiveness because not all amends end well.</a><a name="ts_2096320_2097960_" > And here&#x27;s the key, right?</a><a name="ts_2098180_2105360_" > Like, when you decide, like, if you tell your wife about an affair or when you decide, like, to make amends, it&#x27;s not about you.</a><a name="ts_2106208_2109200_" > It&#x27;s actually you think about what&#x27;s best for the other person.</a><a name="ts_2109380_2111120_" > You&#x27;re fixing what you did to them.</a><a name="ts_2111440_2111840_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2111840_2112064_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2112990_2113170_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2113330_2114880_" > So you don&#x27;t ask them to forgive you.</a><a name="ts_2115872_2120280_" > No, you, you know, the hope is that it&#x27;ll clear up the relationship.</a><a name="ts_2120280_2126300_" > But I&#x27;ve had some examples where the person goes to a relationship that was really harmed.</a><a name="ts_2126300_2130140_" > And the woman said, you know, thank you for doing this.</a><a name="ts_2130180_2133280_" > But I just want you to know, this doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re going to be friends.</a><a name="ts_2133540_2136220_" > They are really good friends for several years.</a><a name="ts_2136220_2138480_" > And then the person did something really mean.</a><a name="ts_2138640_2140760_" > And she said, you know, thank you.</a><a name="ts_2141000_2143460_" > But, you know, I still don&#x27;t want to be friends.</a><a name="ts_2143460_2144580_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2144580_2145380_" > Totally acceptable.</a><a name="ts_2145640_2151260_" > Like, you should not, you should not go into making amends with the expectation that the</a><a name="ts_2151260_2153620_" > other person is going to be nice, that they&#x27;re good.</a><a name="ts_2153700_2154560_" > Like, we would hope they would.</a><a name="ts_2154940_2156560_" > That they&#x27;re going to forgive you.</a><a name="ts_2156740_2157540_" > That they&#x27;re going to be cool.</a><a name="ts_2157540_2158520_" > Let&#x27;s be best buddies.</a><a name="ts_2158620_2159520_" > That&#x27;s not the point.</a><a name="ts_2159780_2160140_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2160992_2162320_" > The point is to do your half.</a><a name="ts_2162780_2163140_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2163340_2163460_" > That&#x27;s it.</a><a name="ts_2163940_2167700_" > Just do your, your 100% of your side of this problem.</a><a name="ts_2167920_2168608_" > That&#x27;s it.</a><a name="ts_2169184_2169740_" > That&#x27;s it.</a><a name="ts_2170040_2170420_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_2170560_2171720_" > And then let it sit.</a><a name="ts_2171720_2174560_" > What&#x27;s happening inside of you at the moment.</a><a name="ts_2174860_2176500_" > Whatever guilt or remorse

> So think about that.</a><a name="ts_2200350_2201050_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2201050_2206410_" > I mean, I was tortured for years by this thing I did to my cousin when I was like eight</a><a

name="ts_2211370_2216370_" > I tell her this experience of when we were kids and we were down the Cape and I, and she</a><a name="ts_2216370_2218230_" > says, Sarah, no memory.</a><a name="ts_2218910_2223230_" > I was tortured by that.</a><a name="ts_2223230_2223610_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2223750_2224950_" > I mean, that&#x27;s the other thing.</a><a name="ts_2225110_2229850_" >

Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2240384_2241250_" > So, okay.</a><a name="ts_2241510_2243130_" > So then here, here comes a question.</a><a name="ts_2243250_2245590_" > Like if you&#x27;ve stolen something, you can try to repay it.</a><a name="ts_2245670_2247930_" > If you don&#x27;t have money, you can work to repay it.</a><a name="ts_2247930_2252970_" > If you can never repay it, you can, I don&#x27;t know what, go to jail if you have to, I guess.</a><a name="ts_2253110_2254010_" > Like that&#x27;s an option.</a><a name="ts_2254270_2259540_" > I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s the best option, but like what are things like harm you&#x27;ve caused</a><a name="ts_2259540_2262720_" > that feels unrepairable?</a><a name="ts_2263360_2265420_" > It feels like you can apologize for it.</a><a name="ts_2265500_2266580_" > And that is a helpful step.</a><a name="ts_2266640_2268380_" > You can take responsibility.</a><a name="ts_2268380_2272640_" > You can say, so I&#x27;m, let&#x27;s just

where living amends comes in.</a><a name="ts_2281850_2282450_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_2282450_2283730_" > It&#x27;s called living amends.</a><a name="ts_2284030_2284190_" > I mean.</a><a

> Trying to convince himself.</a><a name="ts_2368080_2368900_" > He was an okay person.</a><a name="ts_2369540_2376240_" > And, um, instead, and she reaches out to him and he&#x27;s, and they, he, he says he owns it.</a><a name="ts_2376320_2377240_" > He says, I&#x27;m, I&#x27;m sorry.</a><a name="ts_2377280_2378432_" > That was so wrong of me.</a><a name="ts_2379136_2383820_" > Uh, he explains it and then not explains it, but he, he shares.</a><a name="ts_2383820_2390480_" > And the two of them continue this dialogue over email for a couple of years until they decide to meet.</a><a name="ts_2390740_2393140_" > And then they decide to write a book together.</a><a name="ts_2393380_2402160_" > And then he decides to explore the thoughts and the beliefs around women that had led him to thinking this was okay.</a><a name="ts_2402460_2406160_" > And then he shared his experience in a public platform.</a><a name="ts_2406360_2413380_" > I&#x27;m not saying everyone needs to go public with their, their mistakes, but it&#x27;s like because he was willing to share his experience as an abuser.</a><a name="ts_2413380_2414340_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2414620_2421400_" > That provided an opportunity for millions of people to learn from him and consider their ways of thinking that impacted that.</a><a name="ts_2421480_2427240_" > And he can never go back and undo what he did, but he can contribute to the process of healing in that way.</a><a name="ts_2427720_2428180_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2428640_2428960_" > Beautiful.</a><a name="ts_2429920_2430390_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2430530_2432850_" > I can think of another guy who he was drunk.</a><a name="ts_2433090_2441950_" > He punched someone in the back of the head, uh, who was just walking down the street and that guy fell and hit the sidewalk and then ended up dying.</a><a name="ts_2441950_2443950_" > He went through the court process.</a><a name="ts_2444290_2444370_" > Yeah.</a><a

uh, share what he did wrong.</a><a name="ts_2451650_2454990_" > Like, I don&#x27;t, what&#x27;s a different word than confess, Sarah?</a><a name="ts_2454990_2457010_" > (..)</a><a

jewelry</a><a name="ts_2523680_2532560_" > for, um, drugs when I was a kid and, um, cause of my addiction and she passed away fairly young</a><a name="ts_2532560_2533720_" > from alcoholism.</a><a

worse.</a><a name="ts_2565020_2566560_" > So I checked it out.</a><a name="ts_2566560_2567900_" > I went to her grave.</a><a name="ts_2567900_2575980_" > I went to her grave side and I made the amends and, um, and I had to ultimately forgive</a><a name="ts_2575980_2577024_" > myself.</a><a name="ts_2577632_2580910_" > And, you know, then I do work with other alcoholics.</a><a name="ts_2581070_2584490_" > Then I do a bunch of stuff in my, in my daily life to make up for that.</a><a name="ts_2584490_2592540_" > It&#x27;s interesting because, um, it&#x27;s thinking about how, again, to balance the scales.</a><a name="ts_2592540_2593980_" > That&#x27;s the way I think of it.</a><a name="ts_2594100_2595280_" > There&#x27;s all kinds of ways.</a><a name="ts_2595460_2596400_" > There&#x27;s donating money.</a><a name="ts_2596540_2597760_" > There&#x27;s offering services.</a><a name="ts_2598020_2599160_" > There&#x27;s helping another person.</a><a name="ts_2599260_2600120_" > Oh, I know another one.</a><a name="ts_2600260_2600500_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_2600600_2601280_" > This is a great one.</a><a name="ts_2601600_2607560_" > So when I was drinking, I told the friend of mine&#x27;s car, actually not really a friend.</a><a name="ts_2607560_2608180_" > It was a woman.</a><a name="ts_2608180_2615360_" > I was renting an apartment from, and I was going off on a trip skiing to your area anyways.</a><a name="ts_2615720_2621040_" > And, um, when I got back, she confronted me and said, oh my God, I walked out the next</a><a

> So by the time I got sober and tried to hunt her down, she was deceased.</a><a name="ts_2629780_2635760_" > And what I ended up doing is I wrote out all the amends of the sponsor.</a><a name="ts_2635760_2642850_" > I drove to where we used to live together and I, um, I made the amends.</a><a name="ts_2643010_2646530_" > But since then I&#x27;ve given cars away.</a><a name="ts_2646750_2647310_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2647990_2654110_" > When my car gets to a lot of miles, like a friend of mine&#x27;s son&#x27;s in high school.</a><a name="ts_2654110_2656190_" > Who didn&#x27;t have any money and didn&#x27;t have a car.</a><a name="ts_2656390_2658170_" > It was time for me to get a new car.</a><a name="ts_2658330_2659430_" > And I gave him my car.</a><a name="ts_2659690_2660030_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2660130_2664810_" > And I&#x27;ve done that with several younger people like teenagers that don&#x27;t have any money.</a><a name="ts_2665050_2667530_" > So, I mean, that&#x27;s how I balanced out the scales.</a><a name="ts_2668130_2668230_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2668430_2670030_" > You know, so things like that.</a><a name="ts_2670270_2671230_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2671450_2671950_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2671950_2672960_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2672960_2672256_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2673200_2679260_" > And I think, I think when we really look at making amends, I see this almost as like a</a><a name="ts_2679260_2684380_" > path we walk and it&#x27;s like, oh, let&#x27;s say someone sexually assaulted someone.</a><a name="ts_2684380_2690140_" > Making amends might just involve like changing how you see women.</a><a name="ts_2690440_2690720_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2691200_2693120_" > Considering those beliefs on how you see women.</a><a name="ts_2693320_2698280_" > And moving forward, treating women with utmost respect in your behaviors.</a><a name="ts_2698840_2699420_" > Absolutely.</a><a name="ts_2699600_2705760_" > And by embodying this new value of treating women with respect and protecting women.</a><a name="ts_2705760_2706420_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2706700_2707860_" > You are making amends.</a><a name="ts_2708220_2708540_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2708800_2710260_" > For the harm you&#x27;ve done.</a><a name="ts_2710680_2710860_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2710860_2720010_" > And so like when we look at the underlying beliefs that fueled our, our wrongs.</a><a name="ts_2720010_2731250_" > (11 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_2731250_2731930_" > Behaviors.</a><a name="ts_2731930_2736940_" > that, that can create new paths for you and new freedom for you.</a><a name="ts_2737040_2737280_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2738016_2741910_" > And, and, and a genuine sense of self-esteem.</a><a name="ts_2742270_2746710_" > Like a genuine sense of like, I am actually proud of who I am because I&#x27;m a different person</a><a name="ts_2746710_2747130_" > now.</a><a name="ts_2747130_2748800_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2748800_2752130_" > Now, I want to go back to something you just said, which was do this with someone because</a><a name="ts_2752130_2753090_" > our mind can be tricky.</a><a name="ts_2753090_2753670_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2753670_2762050_" > And I think if I, if I remember correctly, as part of this, you, um, tell your wrongs to</a><a name="ts_2762050_2766010_" > your higher power and also to one other physical human being.</a><a name="ts_2766210_2766810_" > Is that correct?</a><a name="ts_2767090_2768810_" > Well, that&#x27;s the fourth step.</a><a name="ts_2769130_2771810_" > So the fourth step is you make a chair for God.</a><a name="ts_2771810_2772450_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2772450_2778330_" > The ninth step is, yeah, God&#x27;s going to be there, but it&#x27;s more, you&#x27;re working with</a><a name="ts_2778330_2779930_" > a sponsor in AA.</a><a name="ts_2780590_2780670_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2780670_2785990_" > So the only reason I say that is I&#x27;ve done rogue amends and they haven&#x27;t worked.</a><a name="ts_2786490_2786610_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2786810_2792030_" > You know, we&#x27;re like, I&#x27;m at my brother&#x27;s house in Vermont and I have the great idea.</a><a name="ts_2792290_2797530_" > Oh, I&#x27;ll make amends to him, but I haven&#x27;t really prepared and I haven&#x27;t reviewed and I,</a><a name="ts_2798290_2801010_" > it&#x27;s okay, but it could have been better.</a><a name="ts_2801250_2801750_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2801910_2804930_" > And sometimes you end up like not being clear.</a><a name="ts_2804950_2812090_" > So my sponsees read them to me and I&#x27;m telling you very often we do, we talk a bunch about</a><a name="ts_2812090_2818750_" > and they redo them and they redo them and they redo them because they sneak in justifications</a><a name="ts_2818750_2819930_" > and rationalizations.</a><a name="ts_2820590_2820710_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2820850_2822912_" > You just, it&#x27;s so human.</a><a name="ts_2823840_2826560_" > Here&#x27;s the only thing I think, cause yeah, we do, we sneak in here.</a><a name="ts_2826560_2827120_" > I did this.</a><a name="ts_2827120_2830180_" > Or I, you know, when you did this, then I did that, you know?</a><a name="ts_2830780_2831180_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2831180_2836240_" > And our brain is very good at rationalizing that, but it&#x27;s also too good at slipping the</a><a name="ts_2836240_2836780_" > other direction.</a><a name="ts_2836880_2842160_" > And this is what I was wondering is like, if someone believes they&#x27;ve done something wrong</a><a name="ts_2842640_2848100_" > and then they share it with a therapist or with their clergy or with a sponsor and that</a><a name="ts_2848100_2851300_" > sponsor is like, actually that wasn&#x27;t your fault.</a><a name="ts_2852180_2854240_" > That can also be very freeing.</a><a name="ts_2854320_2856160_" > So I can think of like three examples of this.</a><a name="ts_2856160_2862140_" > I can think of a girl who, when she was five, her mom told her to watch her baby sister</a><a name="ts_2862140_2863160_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2863160_2865980_" > and the mom was on the phone somewhere else.</a><a name="ts_2866020_2869984_" > And the baby sister wandered into the road and got hit by a car and was killed.</a><a name="ts_2870688_2874810_" > And this lady for her entire life was like, it&#x27;s my fault.</a><a name="ts_2874810_2875770_" > my sister was killed.</a><a name="ts_2876730_2881530_" > And the truth is no five-year-old is responsible for that.</a><a name="ts_2882528_2885260_" > It&#x27;s not, that was not, you don&#x27;t need to make amends for that.</a><a name="ts_2885260_2886100_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2886100_2887648_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2887648_2888520_" > That&#x27;s a great point.</a><a name="ts_2888640_2889840_" > Cause we go through the list.</a><a name="ts_2889960_2890080_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2890260_2893400_" > There are amends where you say, no, that wasn&#x27;t about right.</a><a name="ts_2893640_2893860_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2894060_2899180_" > And I can, I can think of another example in my, in my religious tradition, my faith, where</a><a name="ts_2899180_2901120_" > a woman posted this on Instagram.</a><a name="ts_2901120_2905060_" > She said, you know, I, I had had this kind of negative sexual experience.</a><a name="ts_2905440_2908760_" > And then a later on a boyfriend was like, oh, that was bad.</a><a name="ts_2908940_2910080_" > You shouldn&#x27;t have done that.</a><a name="ts_2910280_2911680_" > Like you need to go talk to the bishop.</a><a name="ts_2911800_2913940_" > Like you need to go, you need to go confess.</a><a name="ts_2914540_2917420_" > And so she felt all this shame, like, oh, am I like bad?</a><a name="ts_2917680_2918080_" > Am I dirty?</a><a name="ts_2918420_2922280_" > And then she went to the bishop and told the bishop what had happened.</a><a name="ts_2922480_2923720_" > And he said, well, can we pray about it?</a><a name="ts_2923760_2924320_" > And they prayed together.</a><a name="ts_2924500_2928100_" > And then afterwards he looked up and he said, you know, I want you to know that what happened</a><a name="ts_2928100_2929720_" > to you was, was not your fault.</a><a name="ts_2929840_2930560_" > That was actually abuse.</a><a name="ts_2931100_2932160_" > She was a little kid, right?</a><a name="ts_2932300_2933820_" > Or young, a young teenager.</a><a name="ts_2934100_2934840_" > It&#x27;s like that.</a><a name="ts_2934960_2938550_" > Actually, you were not compressive on that.</a><a name="ts_2938950_2939250_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2939690_2943130_" > But, but going through the process of telling another human being.</a><a name="ts_2943510_2943710_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2943810_2946270_" > Can help us clear up that trickiness.</a><a name="ts_2946810_2946990_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2946990_2948810_" > Like we can fall to either side.</a><a name="ts_2949090_2950230_" > Oh, it&#x27;s everyone else&#x27;s fault.</a><a name="ts_2950530_2952190_" > Or I&#x27;m such a bad person.</a><a name="ts_2952390_2952690_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2952690_2957750_" > And telling another human can help us clean that up and clear out that queue or that backpack</a><a name="ts_2957750_2958330_" > of bricks.</a><a name="ts_2958630_2958990_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2959330_2959904_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_2960608_2961010_" > Absolutely.</a><a name="ts_2961010_2962560_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2962560_2966320_" > I was thinking of, like we say in AA, this is where the magic happens.</a><a name="ts_2966440_2968240_" > This is where really you get the freedom.</a><a name="ts_2968500_2974680_" > I had this quick story I&#x27;m going to tell you about my second husband, George, right?</a><a name="ts_2974860_2977080_" > And this is where we talk about it.</a><a name="ts_2977080_2983000_" > Like I was a victim in the sense my husband relapsed after a long term of sobriety.</a><a name="ts_2983200_2990080_" > And so my life became crazy for a good two years until I kind of finally got the courage</a><a name="ts_2990080_2992416_" > to say, hey, this isn&#x27;t going to work.</a><a name="ts_2993056_2999960_" > But after a while of, um, post the, post that divorce, I did some more work and I decided</a><a name="ts_2999960_3004720_" > I needed to make amends to him cause we were together for quite a while and he was deceased</a><a name="ts_3004720_3005420_" > by then.</a><a name="ts_3005860_3006100_" > Hmm.</a><a name="ts_3006260_3012030_" > So I, I wrote out my amends and I thought, oh my God, I&#x27;m getting choked up now.</a><a name="ts_3012030_3016090_" > And I thought of this beach in Maine where we used to go.</a><a name="ts_3016190_3019072_" > And I have a lot of really great memories of that beach.</a><a name="ts_3019680_3022980_" > And I got to the beach and it was like in the fall.</a><a name="ts_3022980_3024180_" > So it was cool weather.</a><a name="ts_3024440_3029000_" > And there was a guy getting out of a car in front of me going into the beach.</a><a name="ts_3029000_3031160_" > And we said hello and blah, blah, blah.</a><a name="ts_3031420_3033240_" > I walked down to the beach.</a><a name="ts_3033240_3035260_" > I sat where we used to sit.</a><a name="ts_3035500_3037200_" > I read my amends.</a><a name="ts_3037400_3041500_" > I had a lot of feelings and, you know, thanked him.</a><a name="ts_3041740_3047180_" > Also at the end, I just wanted to thank him for all the positive things that of our relationship.</a><a name="ts_3047180_3051260_" > It wasn&#x27;t just about his addiction that happened in the last couple of years.</a><a name="ts_3052256_3061710_" > And so, um, I walk, I&#x27;m walking back to my car and the same guy is getting back in his car in the next car.</a><a name="ts_3062650_3065770_" > And I said to him, hey, we chatted for a while.</a><a name="ts_3065770_3067370_" > He asked me where I was from, blah, blah.</a><a name="ts_3067550_3071330_" > And then I was about to get in my car and I said, where are you from?</a><a name="ts_3071610_3073088_" > And he goes, freedom.</a><a name="ts_3073088_3074688_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3074688_3075808_" > And I said, freedom.</a><a name="ts_3076480_3078140_" > And he said, freedom, New Hampshire.</a><a name="ts_3078140_3080180_" > It&#x27;s a town in New Hampshire.</a><a name="ts_3080720_3090660_" > And it was like, I have goosebumps telling you this because whether you believe in God or the goodness of the universe or whatever, it&#x27;s like that moment.</a><a name="ts_3090840_3095120_" > I was free from George and everything that had happened.</a><a name="ts_3095120_3100910_" > And it was like, you know, that&#x27;s a situation where someone could be a victim forever.</a><a name="ts_3101190_3104050_" > You know, my husband relapsed and I&#x27;m angry.</a><a name="ts_3104050_3112910_" > And, and you know what, when I own my part, then I was able to not only like own my part, but see the bigger picture.</a><a name="ts_3113130_3120128_" > That&#x27;s the last thing I should say about this is, you know, my brother who&#x27;s a therapist always says, pull the lens back.</a><a name="ts_3120704_3129600_" > And I love that because so often we&#x27;re in our own spin about our realities and our things that have happened to us.</a><a name="ts_3129660_3134870_" > And we forget that other people are having their own experience.</a><a name="ts_3134870_3147590_" > And there, it&#x27;s like when you become a mom and suddenly you see your own mom totally different because you realize, oh my gosh, she was experiencing all this while she was raising me.</a><a name="ts_3147730_3148790_" > I had no idea.</a><a name="ts_3148790_3148910_" > I had no idea.</a><a name="ts_3149210_3150570_" > It&#x27;s the same feeling.</a><a name="ts_3150730_3157290_" > It&#x27;s like when you can pull the lens back and look at the other person&#x27;s experience, not just yours.</a><a name="ts_3157850_3159290_" > I think it&#x27;s really helpful.</a><a name="ts_3159530_3161710_" > So that was one story I wanted to tell.</a><a name="ts_3161930_3163070_" > One last one.</a><a name="ts_3163250_3168290_" > This from a friend of mine is he is out.</a><a name="ts_3168510_3171150_" > Mother was an alcoholic, very abusive.</a><a name="ts_3171150_3176250_" > I mean, this guy, foster homes, abused by therapists, sexual.</a><a name="ts_3176450_3179310_" > I mean, like just endless trauma, endless trauma.</a><a name="ts_3179530_3185610_" > And that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s such a great example of amends because he got sober.</a><a name="ts_3185770_3186890_" > He&#x27;s an attorney now.</a><a name="ts_3187010_3197350_" > And he went to make amends to his hockey coach and his hockey coach and his mother was deceased.</a><a name="ts_3197350_3206870_" > And he had, you know, he still was like saw his mother as like never caring about him, never, you know, speaking up for him and all this stuff.</a><a name="ts_3207010_3220090_" > And he makes amends to his hockey coach and he ends up getting from his hockey coach all of this information about how much his mother cared about him.</a><a name="ts_3220290_3225950_" > Because his mother used to talk to the hockey coach about him and how awesome he was.</a><a name="ts_3225950_3236410_" > And so in that amend, he&#x27;s getting from the grave side information about his mom that he would never have had.</a><a name="ts_3236630_3241090_" > I mean, that just to me is like the magic of this work.</a><a name="ts_3241110_3242650_" > It&#x27;s just so powerful.</a><a name="ts_3242650_3252448_" > And we&#x27;ve talked about so many different kinds that those are a couple of just really powerful examples of you will get things that you don&#x27;t even know you want to get.</a><a name="ts_3253280_3259392_" > Yeah, I do feel like, I don&#x27;t know how to say this.</a><a name="ts_3259936_3266650_" > Like, I personally, okay, I keep going back to religion because this is the language I have around this.</a><a name="ts_3266830_3271180_" > But there&#x27;s this like religious, which is I consider like my practice, right?</a><a name="ts_3271240_3271740_" > This is what I do.</a><a name="ts_3271840_3273080_" > Religion is more like a behavior.</a><a name="ts_3273180_3277980_" > My spiritual practice, my religion sometimes fuels my spiritual practice.</a><a name="ts_3277980_3284840_" > Like this sense of like, there is something big and deep and connected that&#x27;s healing and loving and powerful.</a><a name="ts_3285080_3288380_" > So my religion is my actions and it sometimes help.</a><a name="ts_3288560_3295500_" > It frequently helps me connect with this bigger thing, which is God or whatever is in the universe.</a><a name="ts_3295500_3296200_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3296200_3297504_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_3297504_3306750_" > And there are certain practices that tap us in to this beautiful healing power that is immense.</a><a name="ts_3307110_3311510_" > And whether you are spiritual or not, the effects of it are powerful.</a><a name="ts_3311870_3320030_" > When I read the book by Dick Schwartz, I had that similar experience when I practiced the self energy.</a><a name="ts_3320030_3320990_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3321330_3323690_" > Tapping into something deeply healing.</a><a name="ts_3323690_3325376_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3325376_3328590_" > And when I see people practice gratitude.</a><a name="ts_3329110_3329370_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3329650_3332570_" > And they like, they count their blessings.</a><a name="ts_3332950_3339370_" > They tap into this abundance, this beautiful abundance that exists in the invisible web around us.</a><a name="ts_3339450_3340730_" > This is how I could describe it.</a><a name="ts_3340810_3341230_" > I don&#x27;t know.</a><a name="ts_3341330_3345870_" > You could use psychological terms and say statistically, this is an effective practice.</a><a name="ts_3345870_3347850_" > If you don&#x27;t believe in this, that&#x27;s fine.</a><a name="ts_3347850_3349570_" > But there&#x27;s something real about it.</a><a name="ts_3349670_3350450_" > There&#x27;s something real about it.</a><a name="ts_3350530_3350550_" > There&#x27;s something real about it.</a><a name="ts_3350550_3357720_" > And when I see people, like, slowing down and getting present.</a><a name="ts_3358220_3358400_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3358560_3359620_" > Being fully present.</a><a name="ts_3359760_3362464_" > I see them tap into something really beautiful.</a><a name="ts_3363104_3362464_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3363380_3365200_" > And when I see people make amends.</a><a name="ts_3365680_3365900_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3365940_3369440_" > I see them tap into these experiences like you&#x27;re talking about.</a><a name="ts_3369600_3374310_" > Like something beautiful is transformative in these experiences.</a><a name="ts_3374950_3379830_" > I have goosebumps because in the, in the big book of AA, you know, and everybody&#x27;s got.</a><a name="ts_3379890_3381990_" > And believe me, it isn&#x27;t the only answer.</a><a name="ts_3382050_3384070_" > I just want to say, I know there&#x27;s lots of options.</a><a name="ts_3384390_3384710_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3385070_3393150_" > He talks about you clear this out because you want more space for the sunlight of the spirit.</a><a name="ts_3394050_3394400_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3395040_3395290_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3395470_3403110_" > And I really believe that when we are crippled by guilt, remorse, things we&#x27;ve done, shame,</a><a name="ts_3403110_3404416_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_3404416_3409120_" > and all the ways we try to manage all that, we have no room for the spirit.</a><a name="ts_3409696_3413640_" > And when I can honestly say, and when I share at meetings, I share this.</a><a name="ts_3413820_3419904_" > There is not one person on the planet right now that I have an incompletion with.</a><a name="ts_3420704_3423160_" > And how many people can say that?</a><a name="ts_3423600_3424160_" > Like nobody.</a><a name="ts_3424560_3424940_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3424940_3428400_" > There&#x27;s nobody I run into and I think, oh God, I owe them 10 bucks.</a><a name="ts_3428400_3429792_" > Or, oh my God, I did that.</a><a name="ts_3430368_3434320_" > And most human beings don&#x27;t have that freedom.</a><a name="ts_3434640_3435080_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3435080_3439920_" > Because we&#x27;re holding on to things that we&#x27;re not saying we&#x27;re sorry for.</a><a name="ts_3440200_3444280_" > Or even another thing that just, this is kind of has to do with it.</a><a name="ts_3444620_3447920_" > In this seminar I did back in the eighties, the S training.</a><a name="ts_3448080_3449536_" > I don&#x27;t know if you ever heard of this, right?</a><a name="ts_3450336_3452620_" > This guy Werner Erhard created this training.</a><a name="ts_3452780_3455840_" > There&#x27;s all these big workshops, personal growth workshops.</a><a name="ts_3456040_3462400_" > And he said one time, upset for human beings is caused by three things.</a><a name="ts_3462400_3464032_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3464032_3469790_" > Unrealistic expectations, awarded intentions, and undelivered communications.</a><a name="ts_3470450_3477650_" > And out of fear, people don&#x27;t communicate things they need to communicate with people they love.</a><a name="ts_3477650_3479850_" > Amends or no amends, right?</a><a name="ts_3480310_3483470_" > Just that withholding and not sharing.</a><a name="ts_3483730_3485248_" > And amends is part of that.</a><a name="ts_3485888_3493450_" > And I just believe when we can complete that, like you said earlier in, you know, around, it just completes this cycle.</a><a name="ts_3493590_3496640_" > We balance out the karma and we are free.</a><a name="ts_3496640_3505610_" > So on a practical level, if someone wanted to take action this week to make amends.</a><a name="ts_3505810_3506400_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3506400_3508320_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3508320_3510490_" > What would you tell them to do?</a><a name="ts_3510610_3516250_" > Because sometimes our first attempts at making amends without support and guidance can backfire.</a><a name="ts_3516250_3519780_" > I would think of a super easy one.</a><a name="ts_3520120_3527700_" > Like, say you&#x27;ve owed your brother $50 for 10 years and you&#x27;ve been angry and you don&#x27;t want to pay off.</a><a name="ts_3528340_3531760_" > Like, literally, like something practical.</a><a name="ts_3531760_3532680_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3532780_3542190_" > You know, this idea, even if you don&#x27;t have the way we work through resentments and anger, try to say to yourself, I don&#x27;t want to be thinking about this 50 bucks anymore.</a><a name="ts_3542190_3544450_" > And you may think, oh, I don&#x27;t think about it.</a><a name="ts_3544610_3550370_" > But trust Emma and I that it is affecting your life in a way that you don&#x27;t realize.</a><a name="ts_3550370_3563050_" > So, put him in a category of saying just I forgive him, I forgive myself, whatever stuff you have with him, and just see if you pay him the $50.</a><a name="ts_3563590_3564832_" > Do it as an experiment.</a><a name="ts_3565568_3569610_" > See how you feel afterwards or the following weeks.</a><a name="ts_3569850_3572450_" > See if you get any freedom or clarity.</a><a name="ts_3572450_3581770_" > So, try it and, you know, call up someone that you&#x27;re comfortable with and apologize for, you know, not reaching out to them when they were sick or whatever.</a><a name="ts_3582070_3585370_" > Try to do something that doesn&#x27;t feel that hard.</a><a name="ts_3585890_3586170_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3586670_3587250_" > Start small.</a><a name="ts_3587330_3588290_" > Something simple.</a><a name="ts_3588490_3591290_" > And something very crystal clear, not muddy.</a><a name="ts_3591470_3593930_" > Because the muddy ones may take more time.</a><a name="ts_3594050_3594752_" > What do you think?</a><a name="ts_3594752_3596448_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3596448_3602190_" > I mean, I would say, when possible, consult with a wise person.</a><a name="ts_3602450_3602890_" > Of course.</a><a name="ts_3602890_3604090_" > Whether that&#x27;s a sponsor.</a><a name="ts_3604630_3606950_" > I think most people don&#x27;t have sponsors.</a><a name="ts_3607350_3607790_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_3607930_3618410_" > Or a therapist, or a church leader, or just a friend who&#x27;s not gonna just, like, back you up, but really help you be your best self.</a><a name="ts_3618990_3623110_" > Be like, like, maybe talk with one other human about this.</a><a name="ts_3623490_3623790_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3623950_3624608_" > Great idea.</a><a name="ts_3625440_3627950_" > And then consider how to move forward.</a><a name="ts_3628768_3629060_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3629060_3642320_" > There&#x27;s also a book that I really like that, that kind of teaches this, not exactly, but, I mean, it&#x27;s not as concrete as AA, but it&#x27;s the book, Leadership and Self Deception, or the Anatomy of Peace by the Arbinger Institute.</a><a name="ts_3642320_3643100_" > Got it.</a><a name="ts_3643100_3649680_" > Both of those kind of walk through, like, how we deceive ourselves and how to, how to get an open, like, clear our hearts.</a><a name="ts_3650160_3650420_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3650420_3653600_" > So I, people could read the Anatomy of Peace, that might be helpful.</a><a name="ts_3654000_3654360_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_3654600_3654740_" > I don&#x27;t know.</a><a name="ts_3654960_3660280_" > I&#x27;m sure there, I mean, any kind of spiritual book talks about cleaning this.</a><a name="ts_3660280_3662200_" > just, I mean, I think a lot of them.</a><a name="ts_3662360_3665510_" > I think a lot of them do.</a><a name="ts_3665690_3670410_" > And I think, I am trying to think of a psychology modality that does.</a><a name="ts_3670670_3673570_" > Because marriage and family therapy, that&#x27;s what I do, does.</a><a name="ts_3673790_3677210_" > Like marriage therapy, like you learn how to make repairs and how to fix things.</a><a name="ts_3677510_3677530_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3677530_3678570_" > Couples work.</a><a name="ts_3678670_3678970_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3679370_3685250_" > But individual therapy, I think very rarely, well, I don&#x27;t see it taught.</a><a name="ts_3685510_3687430_" > Maybe in session, therapists are just doing it.</a><a name="ts_3687570_3687970_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3687970_3688690_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3688870_3690210_" > It&#x27;s a really great point.</a><a name="ts_3690230_3695710_" > Because it&#x27;s more about validating someone&#x27;s pain or, and yeah, the repair stuff is later.</a><a name="ts_3695950_3697120_" > You&#x27;re absolutely right.</a><a name="ts_3698112_3704410_" > The thing that kills me is, when we get to this point in the step work, you know, where</a><a

quietly enough with yourself, you are going to know because it&#x27;s something that is disturbing.</a><a name="ts_3734460_3735760_" > It really is.</a><a name="ts_3735760_3736280_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3736280_3741300_" > I think the stuff that&#x27;s harder is the people we&#x27;re really mad at still.</a><a name="ts_3741520_3743800_" > And yet we&#x27;ve done bad behavior.</a><a

out your backpack</a><a name="ts_4080280_4082720_" > are all really valuable, really valuable.</a><a name="ts_4082720_4084608_" > And there&#x27;s a lot of different ways to do it.</a><a

the practice.</a><a name="ts_4100230_4102270_" > And now like all the research is coming out.</a><a name="ts_4102330_4103510_" > We can turn it around.</a><a name="ts_4103510_4108096_" > I mean,
