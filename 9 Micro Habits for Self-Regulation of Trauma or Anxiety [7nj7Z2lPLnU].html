therapist in me who wonders if this minivan might have trauma.</a><a name="ts_4064_8288_S01" > (....)</a><a name="ts_8288_11930_S01" > But to be serious, when you have trauma or anxiety, it&#x27;s like your nervous system is</a><a name="ts_11930_15610_S01" > an overly sensitive car alarm that goes off if anything gets too close.</a><a name="ts_15790_20850_S01" > For someone living with trauma or anxiety, stress, hypervigilance, anger, and fear can seem</a><a name="ts_20850_25890_S01" > to dominate your day and leave you feeling triggered, tense, jumpy, and eventually exhausted</a><a name="ts_25890_26710_S01" > and burnt out.</a><a name="ts_27090_31970_S01" > With trauma, it&#x27;s common for your nervous system to be what&#x27;s called sympathetically</a><a name="ts_31970_32710_S01" > dominant.</a><a name="ts_32710_39210_S01" > The sympathetic state is the activated state, the anxious state of your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_39330_43950_S01" > And it&#x27;s fine for brief spells, but when it&#x27;s chronic, that can lead to some unwanted negative</a><a name="ts_43950_46030_S01" > impacts on your mental health and physical health.</a><a name="ts_46270_51310_S01" > The good news is that we can retrain our nervous systems to be healthier, to be parasympathetically</a><a name="ts_51310_51690_S01" > dominant.</a><a name="ts_52010_57610_S01" > That&#x27;s the calming state of your nervous system, where we feel safe, balanced, and confident.</a><a name="ts_57850_61110_S01" > Then when things get stressful, your alarm doesn&#x27;t get triggered as often.</a><a name="ts_61110_65330_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:01]</span> And when it does, you can come back to a sense of safety more quickly.</a><a name="ts_65750_69370_S01" > But this retraining isn&#x27;t something we do in therapy.</a><a name="ts_69570_75510_S01" > In this video, you&#x27;ll learn nine micro habits you can work into each day to retrain your nervous</a><a name="ts_75510_77910_S01" > system to be calmer and healthier.</a><a name="ts_77910_85040_S01" > Number one.</a><a name="ts_85440_89580_S01" > Usually when people say they want to manage their stress or their chronic hypervigilance,</a><a name="ts_89640_92840_S01" > what they&#x27;re thinking is, I don&#x27;t want to feel stressed.</a><a name="ts_93100_94820_S01" > I don&#x27;t want to get triggered.</a><a name="ts_94940_96940_S01" > I want these feelings to go away.</a><a name="ts_96940_98660_S01" > I don&#x27;t want to be so reactive.</a><a name="ts_99552_100570_S01" > And we can get there.</a><a name="ts_100650_102490_S01" > But the way we get there is somewhat counterintuitive.</a><a name="ts_102490_107776_S01" > The harder you try to just not feel stressed, the more stressed you&#x27;ll feel.</a><a name="ts_108448_111390_S01" > Being anti-reactive is just another form of reactivity.</a><a name="ts_111570_116190_S01" > You&#x27;re reacting to your stress instead of choosing what you want instead.</a><a name="ts_116230_119072_S01" > That leaves you feeling out of control.</a><a name="ts_119936_123020_S01" > If you want to regulate your nervous system, you have to be proactive.</a><a name="ts_123320_126980_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:03]</span> You need to take a moment to choose what you do want your day to look like.</a><a name="ts_126980_131540_S01" > So if the trauma behavior is saying, I don&#x27;t want to feel stressed today, the regulating</a><a name="ts_131540_135640_S01" > habit is to set an actionable intention for the day.</a><a name="ts_136040_141000_S01" > It&#x27;s important to choose something you will do instead of something you wish wouldn&#x27;t happen.</a><a name="ts_141000_147020_S01" > So when we set goals around less of something or something we want to have go away, it doesn&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_147020_148640_S01" > give us very much power to act.</a><a name="ts_148640_153000_S01" > So instead choose forward momentum, something active that you can choose.</a><a name="ts_153000_156700_S01" > So you choose something simple and empowering like, I will be kind to myself today.</a><a name="ts_157060_159280_S01" > Or I will notice when I feel overwhelmed.</a><a name="ts_159380_160440_S01" > And then I&#x27;ll pause.</a><a name="ts_160580_164500_S01" > And you write this down or you spend one minute visualizing this at the beginning of each day.</a><a name="ts_164660_168080_S01" > It&#x27;s better to take a moment and get a clear vision of what you want your life to be about</a><a name="ts_168080_171660_S01" > instead of running around wondering why you feel out of control.</a><a name="ts_172020_175740_S01" > And that takes us to our second micro habit for nervous system regulation.</a><a name="ts_175900_179480_S01" > And this is slow down instead of speed up.</a><a name="ts_179480_184500_S01" > So when you&#x27;re dysregulated, you&#x27;re going to feel rushed, hurried, perhaps a little scattered.</a><a name="ts_184660_189360_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:04]</span> And you&#x27;ll start moving in these frantic, tight little jerking movements when you walk,</a><a name="ts_189460_191580_S01" > when you eat, as you look at emails.</a><a name="ts_191780_194620_S01" > And this sends a message to your brain that you must be in danger.</a><a name="ts_194780_200420_S01" > A simple way to calm your nervous system is to slow down, to move deliberately.</a><a name="ts_200980_204620_S01" > Going slowly regulates the nervous system and sends a message of safety.</a><a name="ts_204620_208384_S01" > So the trauma behavior is rushing and frantic hurrying.</a><a name="ts_208960_211660_S01" > The regulating behavior is slow down and settle.</a><a name="ts_212000_215480_S01" > So you can do this by creating pause routines.</a><a name="ts_215480_218360_S01" > You can build mini habits into transitions.</a><a name="ts_218500_223780_S01" > So for example, before a meeting, pause yourself and take three slow breaths.</a><a name="ts_223780_224864_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_224864_229280_S01" > Or before you eat, check in with your body or say a prayer.</a><a name="ts_230272_234912_S01" > Train yourself to walk more slowly, eat more slowly, respond more slowly.</a><a name="ts_235488_239392_S01" > With your kids say, I&#x27;ll think about that for five minutes before deciding.</a><a name="ts_239392_240640_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_240640_242592_S01" > Okay, number three, set the tone for the day.</a><a name="ts_243136_244670_S01" > How we start our day sets the tone.</a><a name="ts_244810_247450_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:04]</span> A lot of people experience higher cortisol levels in the morning.</a><a name="ts_247730_252630_S01" > And if we start the day to a blaring alarm clock, or we lay in bed too long worrying about</a><a name="ts_252630_257310_S01" > the day ahead, or maybe you&#x27;re exhausted from staying up too late the night before, or the</a><a name="ts_257310_262370_S01" > first thing we look at is the news or social media, basically any of this can prime your nervous</a><a name="ts_262370_263930_S01" > system to think that it&#x27;s in danger.</a><a name="ts_263930_267010_S01" > You&#x27;re primed to feel jittery and tense throughout the day.</a><a name="ts_267270_272470_S01" > And while you can put in the time to calm back down, it&#x27;s better to set a healthy tone for</a><a name="ts_272470_272770_S01" > the day.</a><a name="ts_272930_277330_S01" > So the trauma behavior is starting the day stressed, and the regulating habit is to give</a><a name="ts_277330_278950_S01" > yourself enough time in the morning.</a><a name="ts_279190_280736_S01" > Set the tone for your day.</a><a name="ts_281640_286830_S01" > Meditation, prayer, or reading work for me, and I don&#x27;t mean reading the news.</a><a name="ts_287350_293310_S01" > This usually looks like reading scriptures in bed, or listening to a meditation as I wake</a><a name="ts_293310_293510_S01" > up.</a><a name="ts_293770_299530_S01" > A few other things that make my day go great is if I exercise, if I eat a lower-carb breakfast,</a><a name="ts_299610_303110_S01" > and I can keep you off of that roller coaster of high and low blood sugar.</a><a name="ts_303270_305330_S01" > Take it easy on caffeine or cut it out.</a><a name="ts_305490_309930_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:05]</span> And I promise after a withdrawal period, you can get to a place where you don&#x27;t need coffee</a><a name="ts_309930_310990_S01" > to jumpstart your day.</a><a name="ts_311290_316850_S01" > If you do start off the morning feeling super low energy like a lot of people do, look for</a><a name="ts_316850_319050_S01" > ways to gently stimulate your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_319150_324130_S01" > So maybe some happy music, or something funny, or a lovely hot shower.</a><a name="ts_324430_328830_S01" > This video that we&#x27;re making right now is mostly about people who get stuck in this sympathetic</a><a name="ts_328830_330710_S01" > response, this activated state.</a><a name="ts_330730_335270_S01" > But I am going to make another video about daily routines for people who get stuck in the</a><a name="ts_335270_338050_S01" > dorsal vagal or the shutdown or overwhelmed state.</a><a name="ts_338370_341050_S01" > Number four, schedule in time to rest.</a><a name="ts_341290_344510_S01" > So the trauma behavior is filling every moment of the day with activity.</a><a name="ts_344510_349910_S01" > The regulating habit is to schedule in time throughout your day to rest, recover, regulate,</a><a name="ts_349950_350610_S01" > and check in.</a><a name="ts_350850_355130_S01" > Research shows that we function best when 10% of your day is set aside for rest.</a><a name="ts_355330_357410_S01" > That&#x27;s 2.4 hours.</a><a name="ts_357730_362990_S01" > Now you might say, but that&#x27;s impossible with my kids&#x27; work schedule.</a><a name="ts_363670_364930_S01" > I&#x27;m going to say, really?</a><a name="ts_365728_365970_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:05]</span> Hmm.</a><a name="ts_366130_367170_S01" > Like, I&#x27;m going to question that.</a><a name="ts_367310_373210_S01" > How much time do you save by eating your lunch in a rush while watching shorts versus sitting</a><a name="ts_373210_375570_S01" > quietly to enjoy it and taste your food?</a><a name="ts_375650_380450_S01" > You might be able to do lunch in 15 minutes either way, but one way is regulating and the</a><a name="ts_380450_381856_S01" > other is dysregulating.</a><a name="ts_382432_384310_S01" > How many hours of screen time do you get each day?</a><a name="ts_384810_389250_S01" > Most people average four to eight hours, not counting work.</a><a name="ts_389810_393330_S01" > Screen time is dissociating, not regulating.</a><a name="ts_393590_396160_S01" > So here&#x27;s what scheduled relaxation might look like.</a><a name="ts_397088_402400_S01" > 10 minutes in the morning to meditate or read, 15 minutes to go for a walk at lunch, half</a><a name="ts_402400_407850_S01" > an hour before bed to wind down with a show, or maybe you snuggle your child when she comes</a><a name="ts_407850_410910_S01" > home from school, or you sit on the porch and watch the sunset.</a><a name="ts_411090_414790_S01" > You slow down for 15 minutes each meal, you know?</a><a name="ts_414790_421230_S01" > And honestly, like when I look at my schedule, that&#x27;s probably more than I get per day.</a><a name="ts_421984_423380_S01" > But I&#x27;m going to work on this one myself too.</a><a name="ts_423520_428200_S01" > As a mom, it really is hard to find 10 minutes to rest, but I think when we get rid of the</a><a name="ts_428200_432140_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:08]</span> distractions, mostly our phones, we&#x27;re going to find that we can restore our nervous system</a><a name="ts_432140_432512_S01" > better.</a><a name="ts_432512_433664_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_433664_434570_S01" > Okay, number five.</a><a name="ts_434730_439850_S01" > Trauma behavior, a disconnection from yourself, regulating habit, regular nervous system regulation.</a><a name="ts_439850_440864_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_440864_444810_S01" > So the routine that has worked best for my clients is to have them set a gentle chime</a><a name="ts_444810_449450_S01" > on their phone with a free app like Lotus Bud or Mindfulness Bell, and to schedule it</a><a name="ts_449450_451450_S01" > to go off a couple times each day.</a><a name="ts_451750_457010_S01" > And when that chime goes off, it&#x27;s a reminder to just pause, check in with yourself.</a><a name="ts_457410_462590_S01" > When you&#x27;re severely dissociated, you may need to practice this check-in for one minute two</a><a name="ts_462590_464050_S01" > to four times per hour.</a><a name="ts_464150_467130_S01" > But with practice, eventually it&#x27;s going to come naturally to you.</a><a name="ts_467270_471680_S01" > You&#x27;re going to check in with your body, notice what physical sensations you&#x27;re feeling.</a><a name="ts_472352_477060_S01" > Sometimes, when I do that, this leads me to getting up and stretching for a few minutes</a><a name="ts_477060_480100_S01" > because my back hurts or my legs are falling asleep, right?</a><a name="ts_480220_484960_S01" > You might notice your posture, your breathing, or your emotional state.</a><a name="ts_485120_488700_S01" > And then just get in the habit of gently naming what state you&#x27;re in.</a><a name="ts_488860_493700_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:08]</span> You might say like, oh, I feel shut down, or I feel anxious, or I feel calm.</a><a name="ts_493920_496780_S01" > And this builds emotional awareness without judgment.</a><a name="ts_496780_501060_S01" > You can get good at this by practicing longer mindfulness meditations as well.</a><a name="ts_501340_504000_S01" > And then you could also, when you do this check-in, you can check in with your needs.</a><a name="ts_504060_505240_S01" > Ask yourself, am I thirsty?</a><a name="ts_505300_505880_S01" > Am I hungry?</a><a name="ts_506720_507680_S01" > Do I need rest?</a><a name="ts_507880_509040_S01" > Am I holding my breath?</a><a name="ts_509920_513410_S01" > Meeting your basic needs supports nervous system regulation.</a><a name="ts_513470_518950_S01" > So after you&#x27;ve checked in, then you just slowly, gently slow down and soften.</a><a name="ts_519776_525020_S01" > Okay, the next regulating habit you can work on is to counteract hypervigilance by restoring</a><a name="ts_525020_526420_S01" > your sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_526420_529210_S01" > So the trauma behavior is hypervigilance.</a><a name="ts_529230_530770_S01" > You&#x27;re constantly just scanning for danger.</a><a name="ts_531050_535850_S01" > The regulating habit is to remind yourself that you are safe because you can trust yourself</a><a name="ts_535850_537248_S01" > to get through it.</a><a name="ts_538112_540180_S01" > So here&#x27;s a quick activity you could do.</a><a name="ts_540280_542160_S01" > It&#x27;s called orienting to safety.</a><a name="ts_542780_548150_S01" > When you&#x27;re feeling hypervigilant, you can gently turn your head and look around your space.</a><a name="ts_548150_549664_S01" > (..)</a><a name="ts_549664_553330_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:09:09]</span> What you&#x27;re doing is grounding yourself in this present moment, and usually this present</a><a name="ts_553330_554752_S01" > moment is safe enough.</a><a name="ts_555584_559170_S01" > Name three things you can see, three things you can hear, and three things you feel.</a><a name="ts_559170_561152_S01" > It might be like the floor under your feet.</a><a name="ts_561696_566230_S01" > And this helps anchor your nervous system in the present moment, which again, is safe</a><a name="ts_566230_566560_S01" > enough.</a><a name="ts_566560_567680_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_567680_567890_S01" > Okay?</a><a name="ts_568350_572050_S01" > Another way you can do this is you can carry an anchor object or a mantra.</a><a name="ts_572290_577390_S01" > So you could carry like a small object that reminds you of safety, or you could also use</a><a name="ts_577390_580650_S01" > like a healing affirmation like, I am safe enough right now.</a><a name="ts_580650_587070_S01" > So these acts can condition our nervous system to remember that we are safe right now, right</a><a name="ts_587070_587360_S01" > here.</a><a name="ts_588288_589360_S01" > Okay, number seven.</a><a name="ts_589560_592020_S01" > Build skills to bounce back from triggers.</a><a name="ts_592360_597100_S01" > So speaking of moments of stress, let&#x27;s admit that sometimes something is going to trigger</a><a name="ts_597100_597740_S01" > our alarm.</a><a name="ts_598180_602260_S01" > It&#x27;s not that healthy people don&#x27;t get dysregulated, upset, or overwhelmed.</a><a name="ts_602600_606400_S01" > It&#x27;s that they&#x27;ve built skills to come back to a sense of safety quickly.</a><a name="ts_606400_611380_S01" > With a healthy nervous system, an upsetting event or a scary situation might make a person</a><a name="ts_611380_612760_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:10:11]</span> feel upset for a few minutes.</a><a name="ts_613080_617640_S01" > But with an unregulated nervous system, that same event might leave them upset for days.</a><a name="ts_618080_621280_S01" > They might rage with anger, exacerbate the problem by fighting.</a><a name="ts_621280_624940_S01" > They might numb out with alcohol, or they don&#x27;t sleep well.</a><a name="ts_625120_629160_S01" > And then they just continue to feel on edge, and it just continues and continues.</a><a name="ts_629160_635260_S01" > So the trauma behaviors are an addictive, avoidant, or reactive behavior when you get triggered.</a><a name="ts_635600_640800_S01" > And the regulating habit is you have a plan for when you&#x27;re dysregulated.</a><a name="ts_640980_646300_S01" > This might include something sensory, something to help you process, that&#x27;s like journaling,</a><a name="ts_646640_648920_S01" > something to re-engage your sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_649520_655850_S01" > So that might be like sipping some ice water, or washing your face.</a><a name="ts_656030_660230_S01" > Might be to go for a walk, or listen to some music you love.</a><a name="ts_660610_663770_S01" > For processing, you could write it out, talk it out.</a><a name="ts_663990_669390_S01" > You could share it with a friend, or a therapist, or you could just talk into the voice-to-text</a><a name="ts_669390_672590_S01" > in your phone, or write in your journal.</a><a name="ts_672810_677550_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:11:12]</span> Sometimes when I have a tricky problem that&#x27;s really bothering me, I&#x27;ll kind of draw out the</a><a name="ts_677550_679470_S01" > problem on a piece of paper with a diagram.</a><a name="ts_679690_681450_S01" > And that&#x27;ll help me process it as well.</a><a name="ts_681590_686390_S01" > And then again, to restore your sense of safety, you could try a reminder or a mantra, like,</a><a name="ts_686510_688030_S01" > oh, here in this moment I&#x27;m safe.</a><a name="ts_688270_691310_S01" > I&#x27;ve gotten through 100% of tough days in the past.</a><a name="ts_691630_694190_S01" > I can trust myself to feel my feelings and be okay.</a><a name="ts_694430_698770_S01" > Or you could request support, say, hey, I&#x27;m having a tough day today, can I have a hug?</a><a name="ts_698890_703590_S01" > Or you could pray, God, can you give me the courage to face the day and be my protector?</a><a name="ts_703590_708490_S01" > And social safety, being with someone, is a powerful regulator.</a><a name="ts_708730_711270_S01" > So whenever possible, co-regulate, right?</a><a name="ts_711330_715550_S01" > You can call a safe person, sit with a pet, or even look at a photo of someone who helps</a><a name="ts_715550_716550_S01" > you feel connected and calm.</a><a name="ts_717010_718990_S01" > Okay, so that&#x27;s just a big laundry list.</a><a name="ts_719090_725090_S01" > What I want you to do is to take what works for you from this list and make a plan so that</a><a name="ts_725090_729950_S01" > the next time something bad happens, you go for a quiet walk, you write in your journal,</a><a name="ts_729950_735580_S01" > you call your friend, you remind yourself that you&#x27;re capable, and then you come back</a></p><p ><a name="ts_735580_739648_S00" >S00: <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:15]</span> and you face the problem with that sense of calm and connection.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_740192_742830_S01" >S01: <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:20]</span> Okay, number eight, expand your window of tolerance.</a><a name="ts_743430_749730_S01" > So a trauma habit is being frozen, having like low energy, being really stuck in this overwhelmed</a><a name="ts_749730_753824_S01" > state where you feel numb or you constantly withdraw and shrink back.</a><a name="ts_754560_758290_S01" > The regulating habit is to move your body.</a><a name="ts_758290_763590_S01" > I&#x27;ve mentioned a lot of dysregulated behaviors that leave you feeling tense or jittery, but</a><a name="ts_763590_766610_S01" > healthy regulated nervous system isn&#x27;t calm all the time.</a><a name="ts_766750_774230_S01" > In fact, if you feel too relaxed, too unmotivated, too low energy, you might be stuck in or dominated</a><a name="ts_774230_776510_S01" > by the dorsal vagal response.</a><a name="ts_776510_778730_S01" > This is what we call the shutdown state.</a><a name="ts_778970_785110_S01" > In this case, it&#x27;s great to expand your nervous system&#x27;s capacity by upregulating through movement.</a><a name="ts_785110_790330_S01" > So we&#x27;re going to be doing things that stretch your nervous system, and the way to get back</a><a name="ts_790330_794790_S01" > to this window of tolerance when you&#x27;re in hypoarousal is actually to go through activation</a><a name="ts_794790_797730_S01" > and then back into that sense of calm.</a><a name="ts_797970_803030_S01" > So this is going to look like using things that are slightly stressful that lead to laughter</a><a name="ts_803030_803510_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:13:23]</span> and play.</a><a name="ts_803610_809590_S01" > So if you have a tendency to be dominated by shutdown state, incorporate more movement and</a><a name="ts_809590_810890_S01" > high energy into your day.</a><a name="ts_810890_815930_S01" > If you tend to be dominated by stress and busyness and tension, then you&#x27;re going to incorporate</a><a name="ts_815930_817990_S01" > more play into your day.</a><a name="ts_818170_824110_S01" > So this could look like playing sports or playing with your kids or doing something funny that</a><a name="ts_824110_824770_S01" > makes you laugh.</a><a name="ts_825170_829470_S01" > It could also look like expanding your window of tolerance by adding in some discomfort.</a><a name="ts_829530_836130_S01" > This might look like exercise, fasting with your physician&#x27;s approval, or cold water exposure.</a><a name="ts_836130_840288_S01" > All of these can expand your nervous system&#x27;s ability to tolerate stress.</a><a name="ts_840960_841580_S01" > Okay, number nine.</a><a name="ts_842520_844460_S01" > Intentionally wind down in the evening.</a><a name="ts_844720_848740_S01" > Trauma behavior is avoidance, and the regulating habit is to have an intentional evening wind down.</a><a name="ts_848960_850940_S01" > Okay, so let&#x27;s think about the end of your day.</a><a name="ts_851080_855860_S01" > When you&#x27;re stressed or you&#x27;re anxious, it&#x27;s so easy to just get stuck in a pattern of avoidance</a><a name="ts_855860_857740_S01" > just scrolling through your phone at night.</a><a name="ts_857740_861900_S01" > You can give yourself a little time early in the evening to do this, but you&#x27;ll also want</a><a name="ts_861900_866820_S01" > to create some soothing intentional practices towards night to help you calm down and end</a><a name="ts_866820_868060_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:14:26]</span> your day on a positive note.</a><a name="ts_868320_869580_S01" > Here&#x27;s a couple of ideas.</a><a name="ts_870040_872740_S01" > Journaling or voice notes reflecting on your day.</a><a name="ts_872760_873580_S01" > What felt good?</a><a name="ts_873580_874400_S01" > What was hard?</a><a name="ts_874520_875300_S01" > What helped you cope?</a><a name="ts_875580_880600_S01" > And by writing about this, this can help you build self-compassion and emotional processing</a><a name="ts_880600_881060_S01" > skills.</a><a name="ts_881060_885380_S01" > There&#x27;s another one you can do, which is a somatic release ritual, and this is where</a><a name="ts_885380_889180_S01" > you gently tap or rub your arms and legs.</a><a name="ts_889640_894880_S01" > Or you can lie on the floor, breathe deeply to help discharge stress and reconnect to your</a><a name="ts_894880_895220_S01" > body.</a><a name="ts_895420_900480_S01" > I think another great practice is doing gratitude or the three good things exercise, so you could</a><a name="ts_900480_903680_S01" > just name three small things that brought comfort or peace today.</a><a name="ts_904620_909820_S01" > Looking for good in the world and in yourself helps retrain your brain to notice safety and</a><a name="ts_909820_910140_S01" > goodness.</a><a name="ts_910140_910432_S01" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_910432_911712_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_911712_917540_S01" > Another exercise is progressive muscle relaxation or safe place visualization, and I&#x27;ll link</a><a name="ts_917540_920970_S01" > those in the description below.</a><a name="ts_921450_922690_S01" > Progressive muscle relaxation.</a><a name="ts_922690_927904_S01" > You essentially lay down and you just tense and then relax each muscle group.</a><a name="ts_928672_934340_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:15:28]</span> Or you imagine for the safe place visualization, you just imagine a safe, soothing place before</a><a name="ts_934340_936640_S01" > bed to help you ease your body into rest.</a><a name="ts_937312_936640_S01" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_937550_938550_S01" > So there you have it.</a><a name="ts_938650_942570_S01" > That&#x27;s nine things you can incorporate into your daily routine to help you regulate your nervous</a><a name="ts_942570_944070_S01" > system if you have trauma or anxiety.</a><a name="ts_944290_947070_S01" > And as always, please do not feel like you have to do them all.</a><a name="ts_947230_952970_S01" > Maybe start with one of your anxiety or trauma behaviors that&#x27;s most disruptive and replace</a><a name="ts_952970_953650_S01" > that one first.</a><a name="ts_953930_957810_S01" > And it&#x27;s better to just start with small changes and practice them for a few weeks until they</a><a name="ts_957810_961024_S01" > become habit, and then you can incorporate another new habit.</a><a name="ts_961920_962210_S01" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_962430_964550_S01" > Did any of these micro habits stand out to you?</a><a name="ts_965130_968270_S01" >
