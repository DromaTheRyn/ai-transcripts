I don&#x27;t see where I fit on the emotions wheel. Now, most</a><a name="ts_11630_17390_S02" > people know that naming an emotion is the first step to working through it, but what if</a><a name="ts_17390_24610_S02" > you just feel empty? Like, you just can&#x27;t cry or maybe you feel flat or numb or shut down</a><a name="ts_24610_29630_S02" > or even dead inside. Now, this can be confusing and scary, but it&#x27;s actually your body&#x27;s natural</a><a name="ts_29630_34770_S02" > survival response. So in this video, we&#x27;ll talk about why people feel numb and more importantly,</a></p><p ><a name="ts_34950_47070_S01" >S01: five things you can do to help you start feeling again. Emotional numbness is a common experience,</a></p><p ><a name="ts_47070_52170_S02" >S02: and here&#x27;s what it can look like. Feeling flat, both physically and emotionally. Losing motivation</a><a name="ts_52170_56930_S02" > or interest in things that once brought you joy. Not feeling happiness, but not even feeling</a><a name="ts_56930_62330_S02" > sadness either. Feeling detached, like you&#x27;re watching your life happen from the outside.</a><a name="ts_62690_66930_S02" > Now if you relate to any of that, I would say you&#x27;re not broken. You&#x27;re experiencing a</a><a name="ts_66930_71880_S02" > nervous system response, but a response to what? Like, why do we go numb? Now, I had my</a><a name="ts_71880_76580_S02" > guesses about why my member was feeling this way when I saw that he had submitted a second</a><a name="ts_76580_82240_S02" > question. This is what he said. I experienced a traumatic event that has turned my life upside</a><a name="ts_82240_88020_S02" > down the last four or five months. I&#x27;m struggling with not being able to connect with my body where</a><a name="ts_88020_94690_S02" > I&#x27;m just numb emotionally and physically. Like, boom, there it is. Numbness is often a response</a><a name="ts_94690_100670_S02" > to overwhelming stress or trauma. It&#x27;s one of the hallmark symptoms of PTSD. So let&#x27;s talk about the</a><a name="ts_100670_104910_S02" > stages our nervous system goes through when it experiences a threat. When your nervous system</a><a name="ts_104910_110930_S02" > senses danger, it goes through three steps to keep you safe. First, it scans for help to support or</a><a name="ts_110930_116730_S02" > protect you. Then it can activate the fight or flight. But if you can&#x27;t fight off the problem or escape your</a><a name="ts_116730_121690_S02" > attacker, or if you&#x27;ve tried to overcome the problem so many times and it just never seems to work,</a><a name="ts_121690_127310_S02" > your body may go into the third state. This is the dorsal vagal response, also known as freeze</a><a name="ts_127310_134290_S02" > or shutdown. That&#x27;s when people describe feeling numb, detached, spaced out, or empty. Now, animals do</a><a name="ts_134290_139510_S02" > this all the time. Freezing and going numb protects them from being seen, from making noise, from feeling</a><a name="ts_139510_146170_S02" > pain, and that can help them survive a threat from a bigger, stronger aggressor. Numbing is a protective</a><a name="ts_146170_151550_S02" > response, and humans do it too. It&#x27;s important to remember going numb isn&#x27;t something you consciously chose to do,</a><a name="ts_151550_157350_S02" > your nervous system made the decision. So why do people go numb? There&#x27;s a few common reasons.</a><a name="ts_158210_163530_S02" > Overwhelm or trauma is one of the biggest ones. When emotions are too big, the brain protects you by</a><a name="ts_163530_169990_S02" > disconnecting. Grief or loss. People often expect grief to show up as a lot of tears or sadness or anger,</a><a name="ts_170010_177376_S02" > but it&#x27;s also very, very common that they&#x27;re just feeling flat, or like they&#x27;re not feeling anything.</a><a name="ts_178240_183650_S02" > Chronic stress and burnout. Constant stress floods your body with stress hormones and eventually</a><a name="ts_183650_190030_S02" > this depletes your ability to get activated. Some people call this adrenal fatigue, but really you&#x27;ve</a><a name="ts_190030_196990_S02" > just depleted all your resources and your nervous system is tired of trying, so it numbs out. Depression</a><a name="ts_196990_202430_S02" > is another common cause. This often brings flatness where both joy and sadness feel out of reach. Also,</a><a name="ts_202430_207750_S02" > going numb is a learned survival strategy. If showing emotions wasn&#x27;t safe as a child, you may have</a><a name="ts_207750_212350_S02" > learned to shut them off. Now more on that last one in a moment, but I do need to add that sometimes</a><a name="ts_212350_217470_S02" > numbness is linked to biological or medical issues, including mental health conditions like schizophrenia,</a><a name="ts_217770_222810_S02" > borderline, or bipolar disorder. Exhaustion and chronic illness can also leave you feeling flat,</a><a name="ts_222810_230110_S02" > and so can medication side effects. So if you suspect that that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s worth talking with a doctor. But for</a><a name="ts_230110_234944_S02" > many, numbness is the nervous system&#x27;s way of saying, that was too much. I&#x27;m protecting you now. Okay,</a><a name="ts_235744_239990_S02" > so back to learned habits. Sometimes numbness and dissociation was a coping skill that we learned as</a><a name="ts_239990_245470_S02" > kids to deal with a situation that was scary or painful and we couldn&#x27;t leave. Maybe there was abuse</a><a name="ts_245470_250530_S02" > you couldn&#x27;t escape. Or if your parent constantly criticized you and nothing you did was ever good enough,</a><a name="ts_250770_257590_S02" > your 12-year-old self probably responded with, fine, I don&#x27;t care. Now over time pretending not to care</a><a name="ts_257590_262390_S02" > became real and numbing turned into a habit. We learned to numb ourselves to escape some of that</a><a name="ts_262390_268030_S02" > pain. And then numbing becomes a habitual defense mechanism. Now as a child it&#x27;s the best you can do,</a><a name="ts_268070_274530_S02" > but as an adult you come to depend on this skill long after danger is gone. So what started as protection</a><a name="ts_274530_281430_S02" > morphs into alcoholism or workaholism or screen addiction or dissociation. So as we rely on it more and</a><a name="ts_281430_286470_S02" > more, it becomes less and less functional. The good news is that if you learned it, you can unlearn it.</a><a name="ts_286470_292330_S02" > So let&#x27;s talk about how. Now, when we feel numb, we often try two things that backfire.</a><a name="ts_292510_298230_S02" > Either we try to force ourselves to feel something or we try to think our way out of it. Trying to force</a><a name="ts_298230_303270_S02" > it is actually adding stress to the system. It pushes us further into the dorsal vagal response.</a><a name="ts_303430_309090_S02" > And trying to think our way out of it is a form of intellectualization. It&#x27;s another subtle attempt to</a><a name="ts_309090_313930_S02" > avoid our actual feelings by getting up in our heads. So here&#x27;s five things that actually work.</a><a name="ts_313930_318270_S02" > The first step isn&#x27;t to fight numbness, but to notice it with curiosity and kindness.</a><a name="ts_318590_324760_S02" > So instead of demanding that you feel something, approach numbness like a scientist exploring</a><a name="ts_324760_331100_S02" > something new. Ask yourself, where do I feel numbness in my body? What does numbness feel like?</a><a name="ts_331300_336800_S02" > Now this came up in an interview I did with mindfulness expert Thomas McConkie, and I like how he explains it.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_336800_343160_S00" >S00: To learn to attune to that kind of numbness, a nothingness, like I don&#x27;t feel anything.</a><a name="ts_344128_349630_S00" > Not feeling anything is another kind of feeling. And if we learn to stay with, I don&#x27;t really feel</a><a name="ts_349630_355630_S00" > anything. We&#x27;re surprised that, wow, there are like 20 layers to that. I don&#x27;t really feel anything.</a><a name="ts_356170_362110_S00" > We get deeper and deeper into our actual experience, and it yields amazing insight.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_362470_369310_S02" >S02: Remind yourself that today is a beautiful day to feel whatever you&#x27;re feeling or not feeling right now.</a><a name="ts_369470_375110_S02" > It&#x27;s a day to allow yourself to be where you&#x27;re at. Not forcing it, but just being present to your</a><a name="ts_375110_379950_S02" > experience right now. And this can tell your nervous system that you are capable. It can nudge you up the</a><a name="ts_379950_385610_S02" > ladder toward internal safety. Now because numbness is a nervous system state, not a thinking problem,</a><a name="ts_385610_390850_S02" > we need body-based approaches. So the way through numbness isn&#x27;t to force yourself to just feel,</a><a name="ts_391030_394830_S02" > but to gently reawaken your nervous system. So here&#x27;s a few things you could try.</a><a name="ts_395390_400010_S02" > Grounding with your senses. I think a lot of people are familiar with this, but you touch something with</a><a name="ts_400010_406450_S02" > texture. You notice a color around you, or you put on some music and you listen to it. Your senses can</a><a name="ts_406450_410930_S02" > help you re-anchor to the present moment. Now Peter Levine teaches a simple exercise in his book</a><a name="ts_410930_416410_S02" > Healing Trauma. So you go into the shower, and you allow the water to hit various parts of your body,</a><a name="ts_416430_423450_S02" > and let yourself mindfully feel it. It might hit your hand, and you look at it, and you notice how it</a><a name="ts_423450_428730_S02" > feels to have the water hit your hand. Then have it hit your arm, and you allow it and notice how it feels.</a><a name="ts_428750_436230_S02" > So we can practice connecting with our emotions through our body&#x27;s sensations. Okay, next movement is medicine.</a><a name="ts_436450_442550_S02" > So try walking, stretching, or shaking out your hands. Research shows that exercise is one of</a><a name="ts_442550_447330_S02" > the most powerful treatments for depression. It helps us move back up the polyvagal ladder into a</a><a name="ts_447330_453730_S02" > sense of safety. Okay, number three, restore your sense of safety. When we feel safe, our nervous system</a><a name="ts_453730_463920_S02" > naturally climbs back out of shutdown. So look around the room, move your head, move your eyes. Notice that here</a><a name="ts_463920_469620_S02" > in this moment I am safe enough. Remind yourself, I have people who will support me. One of the most</a><a name="ts_469620_474640_S02" > direct ways to restore a sense of safety is being in physical contact or eye contact with a caring</a><a name="ts_474640_480700_S02" > person or even a pet. You don&#x27;t even have to talk about it, though that&#x27;s not terrible either. You could</a><a name="ts_480700_484780_S02" > do some of the restoring safety exercises from my free grounding skills course, and I&#x27;ll put a link in</a><a name="ts_484780_489580_S02" > the description. You could do a safe place visualization, you could turn on your safe playlist,</a><a name="ts_489580_495480_S02" > or pull out your safe cues sensory kit. If you&#x27;re exhausted, burnt out, or overwhelmed, you probably</a><a name="ts_495480_502320_S02" > need a little break to create safety from whatever&#x27;s draining you. So ask yourself, what can you do to get</a><a name="ts_502320_508140_S02" > some rest? Safety isn&#x27;t just about your environment. It&#x27;s the message your nervous system receives</a><a name="ts_508140_514100_S02" > that says, I can handle this. Okay, number four, ask what&#x27;s behind the numbness. So behind numbness,</a><a name="ts_514100_518840_S02" > there&#x27;s often a huge emotion. Numb is a protector. It&#x27;s desperately trying to protect you from a</a><a name="ts_518840_524360_S02" > feeling. If we imagine this protector, it might be saying, I&#x27;m afraid little Emma can&#x27;t handle feeling</a><a name="ts_524360_531450_S02" > so much sadness or grief or anger or pain. So how can you respond to your protector part? Can you show</a><a name="ts_531450_536970_S02" > compassion to your numbness? Maybe speak to it. Thank you numbness for trying to protect me. Ask your</a><a name="ts_536970_542660_S02" > numbness, what are you trying to protect me from? Or ask it, what would you like to tell me? You could</a><a name="ts_542660_547140_S02" > reassure your numbness part from a place of self. You could say, I&#x27;m not a little kid anymore.</a><a name="ts_547400_553800_S02" > Thank you so much for what you, numbness, have been trying to do to protect me. You could also ask it,</a><a name="ts_553920_559620_S02" > like, would you be willing to step aside so that I can see what&#x27;s behind you? Now sometimes numbness may</a><a name="ts_559620_563840_S02" > be willing to step aside and let you glimpse what&#x27;s underneath. Other times it won&#x27;t, and that&#x27;s okay.</a><a name="ts_564200_570920_S02" > And again, this work might be best done with a therapist. When numbing and dissociation become really</a><a name="ts_570920_576300_S02" > chronic, removing our internal defense mechanisms can sometimes leave us overwhelmed with big traumas</a><a name="ts_576300_583950_S02" > that we&#x27;ll do a lot better with support as we work through them. Okay, number five, act it out. When</a><a name="ts_583950_589010_S02" > you&#x27;re numb or dissociated, it can be really helpful to dramatize the emotion that you&#x27;re not feeling. Now,</a><a name="ts_589030_594810_S02" > I know this sounds maybe a little counterintuitive, but like, hang with me here. There are a few steps to this.</a><a name="ts_594910_599850_S02" > So even if you can&#x27;t feel or name an emotion, you probably know deep down what&#x27;s behind your numbness.</a><a name="ts_599850_606090_S02" > If an observer of your life were to guess, what might they say instigated it? You don&#x27;t have to</a><a name="ts_606090_612970_S02" > force an answer. Like, forcing it pushes us down into the dorsal vagal response, but a guess might</a><a name="ts_612970_617610_S02" > be helpful for this next step. So for example, if someone close to you recently passed away and you&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_617610_623780_S02" > feeling numb, let&#x27;s guess that under the numbness you&#x27;re feeling grief or anger around that. So now,</a><a name="ts_623780_629180_S02" > imagine how someone who lost a loved one would feel and describe that in writing. And I do mean like,</a><a name="ts_629180_634240_S02" > describe. Like, don&#x27;t just say this person would feel sad. Write it like a character scene. Describe</a><a name="ts_634240_639680_S02" > the sobs, the inability to speak, the stomachache, squeezing the eyes, hugging a pillow, so on, so on.</a><a name="ts_640224_645560_S02" > You could watch a video or read a story of someone going through the same kind of trauma that you&#x27;ve</a><a name="ts_645560_651600_S02" > been through. Okay, so this last part like that I just described might sound so awkward that you don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_651600_657650_S02" > want to try it, but if you feel safe enough and resourced enough, like, I do encourage you to try to</a><a name="ts_657650_663090_S02" > act out those emotions you imagined. You could yell or shake or fake some crying. You could pretend</a><a name="ts_663090_668610_S02" > you&#x27;re an actor on stage feeling a character&#x27;s emotions and then act them out. Okay, so there&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_668610_673490_S02" > five options for working through emotional numbness. Recognize that it&#x27;s your body&#x27;s protective response</a><a name="ts_673490_679550_S02" > to overwhelming feelings. Treat numbness with curiosity and compassion. Restore your sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_680070_686410_S02" > Connect with your body. And with movement, dramatize the emotion you&#x27;re missing. With each of these five ways to</a><a name="ts_686410_691630_S02" > respond to numbness or dissociation, you&#x27;re recognizing that your nervous system is just trying to</a><a name="ts_691630_696130_S02" > protect you from something. And if you feel supported and well resourced, you can figure out</a><a name="ts_696130_701850_S02" > what that scary something is and start to heal it by responding to it in healthy ways that counteract</a><a name="ts_701850_707790_S02" > the numbness. Okay, I hope this has been helpful and even hopeful for you that you can restore your</a><a name="ts_707790_715570_S02" > ability to feel sensation in your body and experience a wide range of emotions. You don&#x27;t have to force it at all,</a><a name="ts_715570_721750_S02" > but by taking small steps you can work through it. I&#x27;m working on a whole series about embodiment and</a><a name="ts_721750_726810_S02" > emotional regulation after trauma, so if this resonated you can learn more by checking out that playlist.</a><a name="ts_727190_731430_S02" > Or if you&#x27;re ready to dive deep into the skills to improve your mental health, check out my membership.</a><a name="ts_731570_735910_S02" > I&#x27;ve got 10 courses on everything from how to regulate your nervous system to how to process emotions</a><a name="ts_735910_741056_S02" > and work through trauma. 98% of people who took my courses said that it helped them improve their mental health.</a><a name="ts_741600_745800_S02" > Check it out, link&#x27;s in the description. And if you&#x27;ve made it all the way to the end of this video,</a><a name="ts_746000_751300_S02" > could you please leave a comment or a thumbs up?
