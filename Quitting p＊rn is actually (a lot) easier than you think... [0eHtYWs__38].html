most teenagers nowadays, that is the case.</a><a name="ts_111552_113120_" > Yeah, but for me, it was bad, bro.</a><a name="ts_113760_114310_" > Really, really bad.</a><a name="ts_114450_118310_" > And I didn&#x27;t understand that I used porn as an escape from my own thoughts.</a><a name="ts_118430_119830_" > As an escape from my own life.</a><a name="ts_119930_121210_" > Yeah, I couldn&#x27;t get a girl.</a><a name="ts_121410_123010_" > I had no confidence to get a girl.</a><a name="ts_123170_125290_" > So, I try and go a few days without porn.</a><a name="ts_125470_127510_" > I get to, I think, like two or three days.</a><a name="ts_127750_129790_" > My first trial, and then I relapse straight away.</a><a name="ts_129930_131030_" > And as soon as I relapse, I&#x27;m like,</a><a

work.</a><a name="ts_153510_155090_" > I would never make it past Sunday.</a><a name="ts_155090_158030_" > I&#x27;d wake up Sunday, and Sunday was kind of like my rest day.</a><a name="ts_158050_160530_" > So, my mind was programmed to watch porn on a Sunday.</a><a name="ts_160770_163010_" > And watch porn on usually a Thursday and a Sunday.</a><a name="ts_163190_164830_" > I could not get past those days.</a><a name="ts_165070_166350_" > Right, Thursday was the middle of the week.</a><a name="ts_166350_167310_" > It was a boring week.</a><a name="ts_167310_168950_" > I was not motivated, so I&#x27;ll watch porn.</a><a name="ts_169270_172470_" > Sunday was a rest day, no work, nothing to attend to.</a><a name="ts_172570_173270_" > So, I&#x27;ll watch porn.</a><a name="ts_173550_173950_" > I&#x27;m bored.</a><a name="ts_174430_176790_" > Yeah, those two days always used to get to me.</a><a name="ts_176890_178740_" > Until one day.</a><a name="ts_178880_180520_" > I can&#x27;t remember exactly what day it was.</a><a name="ts_180660_185408_" > But a girl from my school texted me out of the blue, just saying hi.</a><a name="ts_186304_187500_" > I found her a little bit attractive.</a><a name="ts_187580_190464_" > Like, if she asked me out on a date, I probably would have said yes.</a><a name="ts_191296_193230_" > Especially at this point in my life when I was very, very lonely.</a><a name="ts_193430_195410_" > If she asked me out, I would have said yes.</a><a name="ts_195530_196750_" > I wasn&#x27;t going to ask her out.</a><a name="ts_196770_198290_" > I was too afraid of getting rejected.</a><a name="ts_198850_199070_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_199390_200530_" > But she said hi to me.</a><a name="ts_200930_205210_" > Yeah, I think it might have been a Friday or a weekend because I think her friends were with her.</a><a name="ts_205310_206550_" > And that&#x27;s why she was texting me.</a><a name="ts_206870_207010_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_207270_208870_" > So, I got really, really excited.</a><a name="ts_209030_210170_" > We started texting each other.</a><a name="ts_210630_212550_" > Like, you know, little year eight small talk.</a><a name="ts_212750_213130_" > Yeah, hi.</a><a name="ts_213330_213650_" > What?</a><a name="ts_213830_214880_" > What are you doing?</a><a name="ts_215456_215690_" > Nothing.</a><a name="ts_215950_220070_" > All that little small talk type shit that, look, I kind of missed because it was funny.</a><a name="ts_220210_222390_" > And it made me so excited when someone used to text me, bro.</a><a name="ts_222670_222970_" > You know.</a><a name="ts_223370_226130_" > But this text, it wasn&#x27;t just a regular ass text.</a><a name="ts_226330_228170_" > I hadn&#x27;t got a text from a girl in, like, a year.</a><a name="ts_228310_233250_" > It gave me some, it gave me an idea that maybe girls are actually still interested in me.</a><a name="ts_233350_236450_" > Because I was, I don&#x27;t know, some girls were interested in me in year seven.</a><a name="ts_236970_239050_" > But year eight, you know, I kind of fell off a lot.</a><a name="ts_239130_240370_" > I started watching porn too much.</a><a name="ts_240650_241630_" > I had no confidence.</a><a name="ts_241790_243330_" > So, you know, no one liked me then.</a><a name="ts_243730_244000_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_244896_246380_" > But this text gave me a bit of hope.</a><a name="ts_246380_250820_" > Maybe if I just stopped watching porn, more girls will attract, will be attracted to me.</a><a name="ts_250900_253860_" > And maybe this girl that&#x27;s texting me right now will be more attracted to me.</a><a name="ts_253860_254912_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_254912_255690_" > Maybe I can get with her.</a><a name="ts_255770_256610_" > Maybe she will ask me out.</a><a name="ts_256670_257810_" > Maybe my skin will be more clear.</a><a name="ts_257890_258990_" > Maybe my confidence will be better.</a><a name="ts_259210_263310_" > Maybe the, the secret little, uh, women attraction that NoFap gives you.</a><a name="ts_263470_266990_" > So, because of this spike in motivation, I make it to day seven.</a><a name="ts_267130_268010_" > I relapse that Sunday.</a><a name="ts_268170_270336_" > I get past that Thursday and I make it to Sunday.</a><a name="ts_271072_272240_" > But the urge is way too strong.</a><a name="ts_272360_273380_" > It&#x27;s like double the power.</a><a name="ts_273540_274304_" > I can&#x27;t beat it.</a><a name="ts_274976_278610_" > So, I end up beating my mate because I couldn&#x27;t beat the urge.</a><a name="ts_278610_280150_" > Then I fall back into the cycle.</a><a name="ts_280490_283670_" > Thursday or maybe even Friday or Wednesday or, and Sunday.</a><a name="ts_283830_284930_" > It&#x27;s just this constant cycle.</a><a name="ts_285050_285810_" > Two or three times a week.</a><a name="ts_285930_287070_" > I can&#x27;t get past day four.</a><a name="ts_287170_288090_" > No matter what I do.</a><a name="ts_288230_289830_" > It got to a point where I got really fucking bad.</a><a name="ts_289930_293248_" > I had, I had no, I had no idea how I was going to stop it.</a><a name="ts_294144_293248_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_293248_294680_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_294680_296400_" > I had no control over my mind.</a><a name="ts_296480_300520_" > It was, it was like my hand would just automatically touch my dick and stuff.</a><a name="ts_300600_301900_" > And I got so sick of that.</a><a name="ts_302060_305080_" > One day I relapsed six times in one day.</a><a name="ts_305600_305720_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_305820_306816_" > During this time period.</a><a name="ts_307680_309312_" > I can&#x27;t exactly remember what day it was.</a><a name="ts_310048_309312_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_309312_310960_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_310960_313056_" > But I relapsed six times on NoFap.</a><a name="ts_313824_316370_" > I know this is going to sound so cringe to people, but I&#x27;m only saying this for your own</a><a name="ts_316370_316850_" > benefit, bro.</a><a name="ts_317270_317550_" > All right.</a><a name="ts_317690_319520_" > So, cut me some slack.</a><a name="ts_320128_319520_" > All right.</a><a name="ts_319520_320920_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_320920_322120_" > You thought, you thought that was bad?</a><a name="ts_322280_323400_" > I woke up the next day.</a><a name="ts_323820_328640_" > I told myself, after I relapsed six times, I

you really think I&#x27;m going to have a lot of energy tomorrow morning?</a><a name="ts_332840_333760_" > I broke my promise.</a><a name="ts_333860_336420_" > I start my day with an L and I wake up at like 8.30.</a><a name="ts_336700_340400_" > So, because I&#x27;ve already started the day with an L, let&#x27;s bust another nut.</a><a name="ts_340400_343616_" > Try and guess how many nuts I
