It&#x27;s because love can hurt. And if you have complex PTSD, when love first arrived in your</a><a name="ts_23260_28140_S01" > life it came with fear, control, silence, or worse. When the people who were supposed to protect you</a><a name="ts_28140_33540_S01" > caused the most harm, love and fear became inseparably linked. And now you either cling</a><a name="ts_33540_39190_S01" > too tightly or push people away before they get the chance to hurt you. Broken relationships are</a><a name="ts_39190_44570_S01" > truly one of the most harmful, long-lasting results of childhood trauma. But it doesn&#x27;t have to be</a><a name="ts_44570_49290_S01" > permanent. You can learn how to build healthy relationships and heal the broken parts of you.</a><a name="ts_49430_54790_S01" > Like, I&#x27;m serious about this. Attachment styles can change and evolve as you become healthier. You</a><a name="ts_54790_60890_S01" > really can learn how to do this. So this video will walk you through five clear stages to rebuild</a><a name="ts_60890_66350_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:00]</span> secure attachment, even if your early relationships taught you to expect pain. This is also you can</a><a name="ts_66350_71170_S01" > stop settling for the wrong partners or friends and start setting boundaries and finally feel safe</a><a name="ts_71170_84240_S01" > being loved. Esther Perel said, tell me how you were loved and I&#x27;ll tell you how you love. Your early</a><a name="ts_84240_90040_S01" > relationships really strongly influence your love maps, how you give and receive love, what feels normal,</a><a name="ts_90040_94940_S01" > comfortable, or loving to you. The most damaging aspect of childhood trauma is how it harms your</a><a name="ts_94940_100060_S01" > ability to have safe and healthy relationships as an adult. Toxic families teach through example</a><a name="ts_100060_104920_S01" > that love and abuse are usually connected. They teach that you don&#x27;t deserve to be treated well,</a><a name="ts_104940_109700_S01" > or that you&#x27;ll be punished for speaking up for yourself. They send the message that you&#x27;ll never</a><a name="ts_109700_115020_S01" > feel safe or loved, so you might as well settle. Hurtful behavior often gets normalized by our sweet</a><a name="ts_115020_121216_S01" > child minds. You might think, this is just what families do, or I probably made them act this way.</a><a name="ts_121792_126040_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:01]</span> Now because things are unpredictable, your brain gets wired to expect danger and your nervous system</a><a name="ts_126040_131540_S01" > gets primed to get stuck in anxiety. And every relationship interaction is your teacher here. You</a><a name="ts_131540_137160_S01" > will get literally millions of chances to practice this throughout your life. So let&#x27;s first look at how</a><a name="ts_137160_143200_S01" > trauma harms our ability to have healthy relationships, and then we&#x27;ll talk about five stages to rebuild secure</a><a name="ts_143200_149640_S01" > attachment and find truly healthy relationships. In complex PTSD, childhood trauma disrupts healthy</a><a name="ts_149640_155060_S01" > attachment. So here&#x27;s seven common ways it shows up in relationships. Difficulty trusting others. So</a><a name="ts_155060_160680_S01" > growing up in an unpredictable or unsafe environment can make it hard to trust that people will keep their</a><a name="ts_160680_165700_S01" > word or have your best interests at heart. As an adult, this might look like suspicion of partners,</a><a name="ts_165920_172180_S01" > or expecting betrayal, or needing constant reassurance. Number two is fear of abandonment or rejection.</a><a name="ts_172180_176500_S01" > So if a child experienced neglect, or loss, or inconsistent caregiving,</a><a name="ts_176720_182140_S01" > they may internalize that fear that loved ones will leave. And later this can lead to clinginess,</a><a name="ts_182320_187700_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:02]</span> jealousy, or panicking when someone pulls away, even if it&#x27;s just briefly. Okay, number three is people</a><a name="ts_187700_193520_S01" > pleasing and over-functioning. Children who learned to survive by anticipating others&#x27; moods may grow into</a><a name="ts_193520_198920_S01" > adults who ignore their own needs to keep peace. They might chronically overextend themselves,</a><a name="ts_198920_205060_S01" > struggle to say no, or feel guilty for having boundaries. Number four, emotional dysregulation.</a><a name="ts_205360_211480_S01" > Trauma disrupts the nervous system. In adulthood, stress can trigger outsized reactions — anger</a><a name="ts_211480_217080_S01" > outbursts, withdrawal, or shutting down. And this can make it difficult to resolve conflict calmly,</a><a name="ts_217080_223660_S01" > which then creates these cycles of chaos in relationships. Shame and low self-worth. If a child grew up</a><a name="ts_223660_228100_S01" > feeling unwanted, criticized, or invisible, they might internalize beliefs like, I&#x27;m not lovable.</a><a name="ts_228300_233060_S01" > As adults, they may tolerate mistreatment, or settle for unhealthy relationships, or just struggle</a><a name="ts_233060_240640_S01" > to believe compliments or sabotage relationships when things feel too good. Next up is recreating</a><a name="ts_240640_246580_S01" > familiar patterns. Unresolved trauma often pulls people back into dynamics that feel familiar, even if</a><a name="ts_246580_251500_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:06]</span> they&#x27;re really unhealthy. So for example, someone with a controlling parent may end up with a controlling</a><a name="ts_251500_257280_S01" > partner because it feels normal. And then the other pattern we see is overcompensating for family</a><a name="ts_257280_263020_S01" > patterns. So if you hated the home you grew up in, you might try to do the opposite, but this can lead to</a><a name="ts_263020_268840_S01" > overcompensating. So for example, if your family was run by alcoholics, you might have become rigidly</a><a name="ts_268840_275360_S01" > controlling with your healthy routines or work. If they were extremely religious and shame-based, you might</a><a name="ts_275360_281440_S01" > pendulum to an extreme openness to drugs or sex, like a no-shame approach to life that also isn&#x27;t healthy.</a><a name="ts_282380_288440_S01" > Overcompensating is an attempt to not repeat the past, but it&#x27;s usually done from a reaction to</a><a name="ts_288440_294880_S01" > unhealed emotions, and that can just lead to really unhealthy patterns and new wounds. Okay, so there</a><a name="ts_294880_300940_S01" > are so many ways that repeated trauma in childhood damages our relationships as adults, but when you can</a><a name="ts_300940_306860_S01" > see the patterns, you can do something about them. So I&#x27;m excited to share with you how to do that in just</a><a name="ts_306860_312180_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:06]</span> a minute. But first, let&#x27;s spend just a moment on attachment styles. So childhood abuse can make it</a><a name="ts_312180_317760_S01" > really difficult to find healthy relationships as an adult. So we often see unhealthy patterns show up</a><a name="ts_317760_323780_S01" > as three attachment styles. Number one is anxious attachment. You crave closeness, but you often</a><a name="ts_323780_329980_S01" > worry about being rejected or abandoned. And this can look like trying to change others, trying to change</a><a name="ts_329980_335920_S01" > yourself to be loved, trying to be perfect so that the other person doesn&#x27;t get upset, constantly</a><a name="ts_335920_342400_S01" > pursuing them to get them to show you love, or like excessive reassurance seeking. Now, sometimes this</a><a name="ts_342400_348640_S01" > is called codependency, and often people get stuck in unhealthy relationships that continue to mistreat</a><a name="ts_348640_355360_S01" > or abuse. Okay, the second style is avoidant attachment. This looks like withdrawal. So closeness feels really</a><a name="ts_355360_360920_S01" > scary because vulnerability just led to pain in the past. So this can result in keeping relationships</a><a name="ts_360920_368300_S01" > surface level, pushing partners away, or like shutting emotions down when deeper emotions come up. Maybe you</a><a name="ts_368300_374720_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:08]</span> rarely share emotion, or you don&#x27;t let people see your joys or pains, and in the end you end up feeling</a><a name="ts_374720_381660_S01" > lonely and distant. The third maladaptive attachment style is disorganized attachment. People with disorganized</a><a name="ts_381660_387740_S01" > attachment may desperately want closeness, but also fear it. And this leads to like a push-pull dynamic in</a><a name="ts_387740_394960_S01" > relationships. So they often feel conflicted, mistrustful, and unsure how to get their needs met safely. It&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_394960_399760_S01" > common to see a pattern of diving like quickly and intensely into a relationship without knowing</a><a name="ts_399760_404940_S01" > if that person is safe or not, and then it just blows up later. By the way, people with a secure</a><a name="ts_404940_411040_S01" > attachment style are comfortable with closeness and independence. They trust that others will be</a><a name="ts_411040_417040_S01" > supportive. They can both give and receive love in healthy, balanced ways. Now, secure attachment doesn&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_417040_422680_S01" > mean that you always feel safe, and you always feel happy, and you never fight, right? Secure attachment means</a><a name="ts_422680_427290_S01" > that you&#x27;re able to work through fights or differences in a healthy way. So how can you</a><a name="ts_427290_433310_S01" > rebuild healthy, secure attachment even if it wasn&#x27;t modeled for you? This is a slow and gradual process.</a><a name="ts_433430_438590_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:13]</span> There are no quick fixes, but there are fixes. Relationships are always there to be your teacher,</a><a name="ts_438610_444270_S01" > and they provide some of the most powerful settings for neuroplasticity to happen. In everyday moments,</a><a name="ts_444270_450170_S01" > through hugs, eye contact, laughter, or play, our brains release oxytocin. This is the bonding chemical</a><a name="ts_450170_454770_S01" > that supports connection and regulation. Now, as children, we were meant to co-regulate with a</a><a name="ts_454770_459390_S01" > parent. Their touch, their gaze, their heartbeat, and breath should have calmed us, teaching our</a><a name="ts_459390_465230_S01" > nervous system how to self-soothe. But if no one helped us settle when we were upset, we may not</a><a name="ts_465230_471300_S01" > have developed strong emotional regulation skills. The good news is that every experience of safety</a><a name="ts_471300_478140_S01" > helps rewire the brain. Consistent signals like a gentle tone, kind eyes, and predictable behavior</a><a name="ts_478140_484540_S01" > activate the parasympathetic system, shifting us out of stress and into calm. This down regulation</a><a name="ts_484540_491200_S01" > creates the conditions for neuroplasticity, teaches the brain, I am safe now. So in adulthood, caring</a><a name="ts_491200_496400_S01" > partners or friends can model calmness, they can offer comfort, and they can stay present when we&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_496400_502700_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:16]</span> dysregulated. Over time, our nervous system borrows their regulation until those patterns become internalized,</a><a name="ts_502860_508250_S01" > literally rewiring the brain to self-soothe. So here&#x27;s the big question. How do you do it? Like,</a><a name="ts_508250_514150_S01" > on a practical level, if most of your relationships have blown up, or you just don&#x27;t feel safe, or you&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_514150_519490_S01" > just not connected to anyone beyond the surface level, how do you start to build healthy attachment?</a><a name="ts_519770_527050_S01" > First thing is go slow. Don&#x27;t dive headfirst into a deep emotional or physical relationship. You will</a><a name="ts_527050_533750_S01" > not find healthy people that way. Instead, go slow and carefully choose safe, emotionally available people,</a><a name="ts_533750_539950_S01" > and then practice testing relationships slowly over time, rather than rushing in or shutting down.</a><a name="ts_540310_546490_S01" > Healthy relationships take time to build trust and deepen closeness. So take time to build a quality</a><a name="ts_546490_552930_S01" > relationship. But where, you may ask? This is where the therapeutic relationship comes in. So working with</a><a name="ts_552930_558410_S01" > a therapist can help you practice building secure attachments outside of therapy. A therapist should</a><a name="ts_558410_563610_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:09:18]</span> treat you with compassion, understanding, and clear boundaries. They&#x27;ll give you feedback with care,</a><a name="ts_563630_568750_S01" > and they&#x27;ll help you learn how to stay connected through conflict or while expressing emotional pain.</a><a name="ts_568890_576490_S01" > And this can lead to the realization or the rewiring of your brain that one&#x27;s feelings and experiences are</a><a name="ts_576490_582670_S01" > acceptable and worthwhile. This therapeutic connection can become a transitional earned secure attachment,</a><a name="ts_582670_588030_S01" > so it paves the way for similar relationships beyond therapy. In the description, I&#x27;ll link where you</a><a name="ts_588030_594050_S01" > can find a good therapist for you. Group therapy is another good place to build healthier relationships.</a><a name="ts_594050_599810_S01" > You can combat shame and get to know people within the safe boundaries of a therapy group. You&#x27;ll want to</a><a name="ts_599810_607390_S01" > look for one that has clear rules and a wise leader who&#x27;s experienced in group trauma therapy. Therapy can teach</a><a name="ts_607390_612950_S01" > you how to open up and treat yourself with compassion and to set boundaries with others and help you</a><a name="ts_612950_618230_S01" > differentiate between healthy, trustworthy people and those who are unsafe. Okay number three,</a><a name="ts_618770_624390_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:10:18]</span> reparenting. Practice healthy relationships by changing how you treat yourself. Self-reparenting</a><a name="ts_624390_629870_S01" > is learning to give yourself the love, validation, protection, and guidance that you did not get in</a><a name="ts_629870_635030_S01" > childhood. So let&#x27;s just like imagine that you grew up with parents who dismissed your feelings whenever</a><a name="ts_635030_641710_S01" > you were upset. They would say things like, oh stop crying, it&#x27;s not a big deal. As an adult, when you feel sad or</a><a name="ts_641710_647950_S01" > overwhelmed, you might still hear that inner critical voice telling you to get over it. Reparenting would</a><a name="ts_647950_654870_S01" > mean noticing and pausing that critical voice and instead offering yourself the kind of response a</a><a name="ts_654870_659530_S01" > nurturing parent would give. You could say to yourself something like, it makes sense that you&#x27;re sad right</a><a name="ts_659530_665470_S01" > now. I&#x27;m here for you and it&#x27;s okay to take a moment to feel this. We usually relate to others the way we</a><a name="ts_665470_671030_S01" > relate to ourselves, whether that&#x27;s with fear or disdain or compassion and hope. Every time you</a><a name="ts_671030_677130_S01" > practice treating yourself with compassion or you set firm boundaries for yourself and you discipline</a><a name="ts_677130_684210_S01" > yourself in a safe and kind way, you&#x27;re practicing having healthy relationships. Okay number four, get a pet?</a><a name="ts_684410_689470_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:11:24]</span> Maybe. Okay so for many people with childhood trauma, the process of rebuilding healthy relationships</a><a name="ts_689470_695270_S01" > seems so far away that a pet is really a good way to start. So not only is it good practice at being</a><a name="ts_695270_700890_S01" > consistent and loving, but a pet often gives unconditional love. It&#x27;s excited to see you, which triggers that</a><a name="ts_700890_706190_S01" > release of oxytocin, and that&#x27;s the love hormone that helps build attachment and makes you feel safe and</a><a name="ts_706190_712530_S01" > wanted. Now a pet is not right for everyone and it&#x27;s not going to solve all your problems, but it might be a good</a><a name="ts_712530_719550_S01" > stepping stone for some people. Okay fifth is earned secure attachments. An earned secure attachment is</a><a name="ts_719550_724770_S01" > a true friend or partner, someone who isn&#x27;t paid to spend time with you, but truly likes you, and you</a><a name="ts_724770_729790_S01" > each support each other. It&#x27;s a healthy attachment that you develop after doing some healing work.</a><a name="ts_729890_735310_S01" > This could be a friend, a co-worker, or a partner. Now not all earned secure attachments need to be at the</a><a name="ts_735310_741230_S01" > deepest level of intimacy. You can have a true friend at work, but she might not need to know the deepest details of</a><a name="ts_741230_746210_S01" > your life. Sometimes it&#x27;s great to have a couple of good friends who you connect with on sports or music,</a><a name="ts_746210_752320_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:26]</span> but you only show them parts of yourself. Boundaries are a healthy thing here, so this means that you</a><a name="ts_752320_758270_S01" > get to decide how much of yourself you share with them and how close you are to them. With good</a><a name="ts_758270_764010_S01" > relationships you&#x27;ll also get to practice with healthy disagreement. Trauma often wires us to avoid</a><a name="ts_764010_770810_S01" > conflict or explode in it. In healthy relationships we get to practice repair, disagreeing, calming down,</a><a name="ts_770810_777250_S01" > reconnecting, and each repair experience lays new neural tracks. It teaches our brain that conflict</a><a name="ts_777250_784170_S01" > doesn&#x27;t mean abandonment, and it can end in closeness. All right, we are all a work in progress when it</a><a name="ts_784170_789770_S01" > comes to relationships. Friendships, marriages, working together, these are all wonderful opportunities</a><a name="ts_789770_796030_S01" > to keep learning and growing. My last bit of advice is as you build healthy attachment is to keep a growth</a><a name="ts_796030_801230_S01" > mindset. You&#x27;re not going to do it all perfectly. Not all relationships will last. Other people will</a><a name="ts_801230_807070_S01" > make mistakes, and you might hurt other people too sometimes. Learn to apologize and make repairs. Use</a><a name="ts_807070_811370_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:13:27]</span> these opportunities as a chance to grow. Don&#x27;t believe the voices that tell you that you&#x27;re broken,</a><a name="ts_811370_816090_S01" > unlovable, or defective. These are skills that can be learned not just on a cognitive level,</a><a name="ts_816250_821790_S01" > but on a nervous system level. You&#x27;ll get dozens of chances every day to interact with people and</a><a name="ts_821790_827550_S01" > practice and heal. I&#x27;ve said it before and I&#x27;ll say it again. Deep healing happens in relationships.</a><a name="ts_827630_834190_S01" > If you&#x27;ve been through trauma, I&#x27;m going to encourage you to take small, safe risks in forming connections</a><a name="ts_834190_840770_S01" > and learn to tolerate the vulnerability that comes with healthy closeness. As you do the work, you&#x27;ll start</a><a name="ts_840770_845350_S01" > to connect with healthier people, and you&#x27;ll gradually notice that you&#x27;re building longer-lasting,</a><a name="ts_845550_851070_S01" > high-quality relationships.
