situation.</a><a name="ts_37810_40390_S01" > Emotional flashbacks are one of the hallmark symptoms</a><a name="ts_40390_44470_S01" > of complex PTSD, a condition often caused</a><a

therapist, an author,</a><a name="ts_51670_56110_S01" > and a survivor of CPTSD, describes emotional flashbacks</a><a name="ts_56110_60610_S01" > as a sudden intense regression into the emotional

triggers an intense, overwhelming emotional state.</a><a name="ts_73370_76570_S01" > You might feel small, worthless, scared, or alone.</a><a name="ts_76570_78650_S01" > You might get flooded with shame,</a><a name="ts_79170_81390_S01" > or your body may freeze or shut down.</a><a name="ts_81530_83630_S01" > You might feel completely hopeless, abandoned, or alone.</a><a

resilient.</a><a name="ts_111430_113030_S01" > And the more you practice these strategies,</a><a name="ts_113170_115710_S01" > the less likely you are to have emotional flashbacks in the future.</a><a

>[00:02:04]</span> Step number one, say to yourself,</a><a name="ts_126790_128450_S01" > I am having a flashback.</a><a name="ts_128870_130170_S01" > This is your anchor.</a><a name="ts_130350_132670_S01" > It can help keep you grounded in the present moment.</a><a name="ts_133210_137030_S01" > Naming the experience helps you shift from being the flashback</a><a name="ts_137030_139190_S01" > to witnessing the flashback.</a><a name="ts_139310_141010_S01" > Say it out loud or in your mind.</a><a name="ts_141070_142270_S01" > This is a flashback.</a><a name="ts_142350_144030_S01" > I&#x27;m not in danger right now.</a><a name="ts_144150_145920_S01" > This feeling is a memory.</a><a name="ts_146464_148730_S01" > Now, a flashback takes you into feelings and sensations</a><a name="ts_148730_151010_S01" > that make you feel like you&#x27;re helpless or hopeless.</a><a name="ts_151330_155250_S01" > By naming it, you create space between the feeling and your identity.</a><a name="ts_155330_156150_S01" > You start to remember,</a><a name="ts_156250_158430_S01" > this isn&#x27;t who I am.</a><a name="ts_158570_160224_S01" > This is an emotional memory.</a><a name="ts_160224_161440_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_161440_163050_S01" > Okay, number two, remind yourself,</a><a name="ts_163190_165350_S01" > I feel afraid, but I am not in danger.</a><a name="ts_165550_167150_S01" > This is a crucial distinction.</a><a name="ts_167150_170470_S01" > Emotional flashbacks hijack your body with fear,</a><a name="ts_170510_172330_S01" > even when there&#x27;s no real threat.</a><a name="ts_172590_175910_S01" > So speak safety to your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_176310_178430_S01" > Try saying, I&#x27;m safe right now.</a><a name="ts_178670_180010_S01" > I&#x27;m in my living room.</a><a name="ts_180130_181270_S01" > I have choices.</a><a name="ts_181550_183970_S01" > You can use your senses to ground you to the present.</a><a name="ts_184010_185730_S01" > You can look around the room.</a><a name="ts_186110_188890_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:06]</span> You can feel the floor under your feet.</a><a name="ts_189050_192570_S01" > You can notice the light or the temperature or the sounds.</a><a name="ts_193110_194930_S01" > You are not in the past.</a><a name="ts_194930_197056_S01" > You are here right now.</a><a name="ts_197056_198400_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_198400_201800_S01" > Okay, number three, own your right to have boundaries and say no.</a><a name="ts_202340_205200_S01" > Flashbacks often bring up deep fears of saying no,</a><a name="ts_205360_207580_S01" > especially if you were punished or shamed</a><a name="ts_207580_210940_S01" > for leaving a situation or speaking up when you were a child.</a><a name="ts_211220_214040_S01" > In the present, you have the right to set boundaries.</a><a name="ts_214220_217780_S01" > You are free to leave or protest unfair behavior.</a><a name="ts_218020_221520_S01" > If something feels overwhelming or triggering, you can step away.</a><a name="ts_221520_222600_S01" > You can pause.</a><a name="ts_222600_223540_S01" > You can say no.</a><a name="ts_224020_226320_S01" > You could practice saying this right now.</a><a name="ts_226480_228768_S01" > It&#x27;s okay for me to protect myself.</a><a name="ts_229376_230450_S01" > I can take space.</a><a name="ts_230450_235530_S01" > I say no to feel in the blank, right?</a><a name="ts_235750_238250_S01" > That might be whatever&#x27;s pressing on you, feeling rushed,</a><a name="ts_238710_240930_S01" > believing that you&#x27;re bad, your own inner critic.</a><a name="ts_241230_244050_S01" > Or you could say no to something that&#x27;s crossing your boundaries.</a><a name="ts_244864_248896_S01" > Okay, step four, speak reassuringly to your inner child.</a><a name="ts_249504_253920_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:09]</span> Picture a small version of you, scared, hurt, maybe shaking.</a><a name="ts_254680_256380_S01" > That part of you needs comfort.</a><a name="ts_256820_258912_S01" > Try saying, I see you.</a><a name="ts_259456_260190_S01" > I know this is hard.</a><a name="ts_260410_261270_S01" > I&#x27;m here for you.</a><a name="ts_261390_262432_S01" > You&#x27;re not alone anymore.</a><a name="ts_263040_266390_S01" > Use the same kindness toward yourself and your emotions</a><a name="ts_266390_267936_S01" > that you would show a frightened child.</a><a name="ts_268736_270610_S01" > In this moment, you&#x27;re reparenting yourself.</a><a name="ts_270990_273250_S01" > The adult you speaks to your inner child</a><a name="ts_273250_274870_S01" > with unconditional love and reassurance.</a><a name="ts_275070_275950_S01" > I love you.</a><a name="ts_276230_277910_S01" > I know we can get through this.</a><a name="ts_277910_280350_S01" > Now you&#x27;re gonna have a tendency to have your inner critic</a><a name="ts_280350_281730_S01" > just yell at you for having emotions</a><a name="ts_281730_282890_S01" > and being so weak or something.</a><a

name="ts_288700_291520_S01" > That&#x27;s you doing the role that your parents played to you</a><a name="ts_291520_292820_S01" > or whatever critic was.</a><a name="ts_292960_294540_S01" > So instead, do the opposite.</a><a name="ts_295080_296720_S01" > Speak to your child with love.</a><a name="ts_297280_300760_S01" > Okay, number five, remind yourself that flashbacks are time limited.</a><a name="ts_301220_303700_S01" > Flashbacks feel like they&#x27;re gonna last forever, but they won&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_303820_306540_S01" > Your nervous system will eventually come back to baseline.</a><a name="ts_306540_307860_S01" > You might say to yourself,</a><a name="ts_308000_309440_S01" > This will pass.</a><a name="ts_309700_312340_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:09]</span> I&#x27;ve been through this before and I&#x27;ve made it through.</a><a name="ts_312520_313984_S01" > I can ride the wave.</a><a name="ts_314560_317110_S01" > You can just visualize this emotion like a storm cloud.</a><a name="ts_317290_320480_S01" > It rolls in and it will also roll out.</a><a name="ts_321312_322490_S01" > This is not a catastrophe.</a><a name="ts_322490_323990_S01" > It&#x27;s just a passing storm.</a><a name="ts_324190_325550_S01" > It might be a very loud storm.</a><a name="ts_325730_329600_S01" > It might be a downpour, but it will ebb and dry up.</a><a name="ts_330368_333248_S01" > And also, sometimes the desert needs rain.</a><a name="ts_333824_334600_S01" > So more on that later.</a><a name="ts_335160_338880_S01" > Okay, number six, remind yourself that you are in an adult body.</a><a name="ts_339360_343800_S01" > Pete Walker says feeling small and fragile is a sign of a flashback, but now you&#x27;re an adult.</a><a name="ts_343820_347680_S01" > You have allies, skills, and resources to protect you that you never had as a child.</a><a name="ts_347940_350560_S01" > This includes things like you can have your own money.</a><a name="ts_350560_351560_S01" > You can live where you want.</a><a name="ts_351680_354440_S01" > You can choose to stay in or leave relationships.</a><a name="ts_354800_358940_S01" > You can make your own choices, sign your own documents, speak up for what&#x27;s right,</a><a name="ts_358940_360740_S01" > and tell your own story.</a><a name="ts_361020_363240_S01" > Your trauma might have been at the beginning of your story,</a><a name="ts_363300_367424_S01" > but you get to pick it up right here and write the victorious ending.</a><a name="ts_367424_368768_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_368768_371180_S01" > Okay, number seven, ease back into your body.</a><a name="ts_371460_374620_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:11]</span> Grounding helps you bring your body and brain back to the present moment.</a><a name="ts_374960_381970_S01" > So you could try some simple activities like scan your body starting at your feet,</a><a name="ts_382110_385330_S01" > and just tense each muscle group, and then relax.</a><a name="ts_385330_386624_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_386624_390720_S01" > Walker says tight muscles send false danger signals to your brain.</a><a name="ts_391328_395710_S01" > So when you control that tension and then purposely relax the muscles,</a><a name="ts_395830_398240_S01" > it cues your brain to feel safe.</a><a name="ts_399232_403780_S01" > Breathing slowly and allowing your stomach to soften</a><a name="ts_403780_407616_S01" > can also send those safety signals to your brain.</a><a name="ts_407616_408704_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_408704_409430_S01" > Slow down.</a><a name="ts_409430_410464_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_410464_414240_S01" > Rushing presses your brain&#x27;s flight response button.</a><a name="ts_414944_418240_S01" > Going slow sends the message that you are confident and safe.</a><a name="ts_419232_423400_S01" > So another thing that a lot of survivors do is when they feel a sensation in their body,</a><a name="ts_423540_425620_S01" > they get a little anxious about what they&#x27;re feeling.</a><a name="ts_425620_429040_S01" > So instead, just drop the struggle against your sensations.</a><a name="ts_429180_431700_S01" > You can feel the fear in your body without reacting to it.</a><a name="ts_432280_435160_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:12]</span> Pete says, fear is just an energy in your body.</a><a name="ts_435160_437380_S01" > It cannot hurt you if you do not run from it.</a><a name="ts_437740_439380_S01" > Get curious about those sensations.</a><a name="ts_439560_440400_S01" > Allow them to be there.</a><a name="ts_440940_443968_S01" > Turn up your willingness dial to be right where you are.</a><a name="ts_444640_446170_S01" > When you lean in and allow yourself to feel,</a><a name="ts_446230_450410_S01" > you&#x27;ll start to build confidence in your ability to handle emotional flashbacks.</a><a name="ts_450410_454350_S01" > Now you can also learn more of these skills for free with my online course,</a><a name="ts_454450_456370_S01" > Grounding Skills for Stress, Anxiety, and PTSD,</a><a name="ts_456850_458770_S01" > where you can learn to regulate your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_458850_460170_S01" > I&#x27;m going to link that below for you.</a><a name="ts_460310_460830_S01" > Check it out.</a><a name="ts_461410_461970_S01" > Okay, number eight.</a><a name="ts_462250_465450_S01" > Resist the inner critic&#x27;s drastic or hopeless narratives.</a><a name="ts_466050_468890_S01" > Flashbacks often come with a wave of hopeless thoughts,</a><a name="ts_468910_474176_S01" > like, ooh, I&#x27;ll never get better, or no one will ever love me, or I&#x27;m a complete failure.</a><a name="ts_474720_476290_S01" > These are emotional distortions.</a><a name="ts_476290_477650_S01" > You don&#x27;t have to believe them.</a><a name="ts_477990_480110_S01" > So say to yourself instead, like, this is temporary.</a><a name="ts_480350_481630_S01" > My brain is overwhelmed right now.</a><a name="ts_481910_484000_S01" > I will think more clearly when I&#x27;m calm.</a><a name="ts_484896_487610_S01" > And if you want to feel even more powerful against your inner critic,</a><a name="ts_487730_494250_S01" > Pete says to channel the anger of self-attack into saying no to your critic&#x27;s unfair self-criticism.</a><a name="ts_494290_497490_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:14]</span> So if your inner critic is like, oh, you&#x27;re such a loser.</a><a name="ts_497630_498750_S01" > You&#x27;re so weak for feeling this way.</a><a name="ts_498970_500410_S01" > No, stop that.</a><a name="ts_500670_502090_S01" > I am okay.</a><a name="ts_502110_505550_S01" > I&#x27;m a human, and I&#x27;m allowed to feel my feelings, right?</a><a name="ts_506130_511490_S01" > It&#x27;s also
