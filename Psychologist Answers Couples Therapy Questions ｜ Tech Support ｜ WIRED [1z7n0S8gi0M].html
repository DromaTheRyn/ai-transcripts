almost the most common dynamic that gets formed in a relationship and sometimes</a><a name="ts_227080_231480_" > people can take turns in terms of who&#x27;s the one that wants and who&#x27;s the one that retreats.</a><a name="ts_231480_235340_" > I sometimes think of it as a hairdryer kind of chasing a paper bag.</a><a name="ts_235520_238040_" > There&#x27;s always some dynamic of push and

sometimes it&#x27;s a good idea to paradoxically turn things around.</a><a name="ts_255500_260660_" > And when you realize that someone needs space, move back, lean back, take your own space,</a><a

it&#x27;s a good chance to talk about things that it feels too risky to talk about when you&#x27;re on your own.</a><a name="ts_294130_299650_" > And what you learn in couples therapy is how to create space for a more risk taking,</a><a name="ts_300190_304610_" > dynamic, interesting conversation that eventually you&#x27;ll be able to take home</a><a name="ts_304610_306810_" > and you won&#x27;t

jargon, but it&#x27;s also a real thing in the sense that we all carry within us</a><a name="ts_322530_326830_" > our childhood and memories of what it was like to be a child.</a><a name="ts_326830_331590_" > And we still have needs and feelings that pertain to that part of ourselves.</a><a name="ts_331850_338130_" > Now, some people continuously grow from their inner child and keep evolving and evolving and evolving.</a><a name="ts_338270_342970_" > And some people live in a more fragmented or dissociated way.</a><a name="ts_343190_346930_" > I&#x27;m not saying this is a pathological way of being, it&#x27;s just we&#x27;re different that way.</a><a name="ts_346930_352870_" > And some people really do keep within themselves a part that really is like an inner child,</a><a name="ts_352910_358710_" > a part of themselves that hasn&#x27;t necessarily developed and that they progress to or turn to</a><a name="ts_358710_363150_" > under certain situations. And then they really feel inside like a child.</a><a name="ts_363150_371450_" > But I think it&#x27;s important for us to all when we love another person to actually tune in and to see that</a><a name="ts_371450_380010_" > all of us still have childish, vulnerable, needy, small parts that are worth paying attention to.</a><a name="ts_380190_385850_" > Katie Said It asks, are couples therapists not allowed to tell their clients to break up?</a><a name="ts_386010_389890_" > It&#x27;s not that we&#x27;re not allowed as couples therapists to tell people to break up.</a><a name="ts_389890_396130_" > Katie Said I&#x27;m sure plenty of couples therapists do say to people maybe it&#x27;s time to break up.</a><a name="ts_396530_400490_" > I tend to be kind of indeed an optimist and a romantic.</a><a name="ts_400870_405830_" > Most of the time I like to support couples in their attempt to find each other.</a><a name="ts_406030_410450_" > And I don&#x27;t really see my job as to tell people how to live their lives.</a><a name="ts_410610_415370_" > I assume if they&#x27;re coming to see me they want to figure out a way to make things work.</a><a name="ts_415530_419150_" > And it might be really challenging and that&#x27;s a good challenge to face.</a><a name="ts_419150_426770_" > because the challenge in a relationship is to find a way to accept and know your partner</a><a name="ts_426770_431670_" > and take them as they are and address what is coming up in you that is getting in the way.</a><a name="ts_431790_437730_" > Was This

that.</a><a name="ts_441070_446790_" > I mean one&#x27;s fantasy life is generally one&#x27;s private experience and you don&#x27;t owe it to anyone.</a><a name="ts_447230_451450_" > But for some people in relationships it&#x27;s actually exciting and a fun thing to know</a><a name="ts_451450_454070_" > about what&#x27;s going on in your partner&#x27;s fantasy life.</a><a name="ts_454230_455670_" > And for some people it&#x27;s too threatening.</a><a name="ts_456070_457410_" > So it depends on your partner.</a><a name="ts_457850_459630_" > Tiams to me is asking,</a><a name="ts_459830_462870_" > Successful couples don&#x27;t fight less than other couples.</a><a name="ts_463070_463950_" > They fight better.</a><a name="ts_463950_469950_" > That&#x27;s a quote from John Gottman and Julie Schwartz Gottman who have done a lot of research on couples work.</a><a name="ts_470110_471650_" > I agree with that statement.</a><a name="ts_472490_478860_" > Not disagreeing or not fighting is not a realistic possibility between two people that are obviously</a><a name="ts_478860_480680_" > different because you&#x27;re two people.</a><a name="ts_480880_482780_" > So you&#x27;re not going to see the same way.</a><a name="ts_482860_484160_" > You&#x27;re not going to need the same things.</a><a name="ts_484280_485600_" > You&#x27;re going to disagree on things.</a><a name="ts_485600_487760_" > But then what happens when you disagree?</a><a name="ts_487960_490880_" > Couples form a certain kind of political system between them.</a><a name="ts_491300_495020_" > So are you an autocratic political system?</a><a name="ts_495240_496800_" > Do you try to control each other?</a><a name="ts_496960_500260_" > Or do you try a democratic way of negotiating difference?</a><a name="ts_500500_501740_" > Listen well to each other.</a><a name="ts_501920_503120_" > Figure out how to compromise.</a><a name="ts_503500_504700_" > Figure out how to take turns.</a><a name="ts_505080_506600_" > Fighting well is an art.</a><a name="ts_506920_510080_" > Bipolar Mind At No Ease asks,</a><a name="ts_510280_514600_" > Do men not realize that only showing affection when they want sex</a><a name="ts_514600_517520_" > makes us disinclined to physical touch?</a><a name="ts_517740_523820_" > Yeah, that is a pretty common thing that women complain about.</a><a name="ts_524140_532440_" > I think one of the issues here is that certain men, and this is luckily changing with the younger</a><a name="ts_532440_539920_" > generation, sometimes do not really know how to establish a feeling of connection and affection</a><a name="ts_539920_542400_" > and warmth when it&#x27;s not sexual.</a><a name="ts_542600_550300_" > Meaning they have sex as one of their only languages to actually feel close to another person.</a><a name="ts_550500_556540_" > Which can be off-putting to a woman who has other ways of feeling affection and connection.</a><a name="ts_556820_563000_" > Part of the work is to expand the vocabulary of what the man learns how to do.</a><a name="ts_563000_568480_" > In a way, model and teach what it means to be affectionate when it doesn&#x27;t immediately equal sex.</a><a name="ts_568720_570900_" > Savage on Autopilot asks,</a><a name="ts_571360_574440_" > For those with homophobic parents, how do I do it?</a><a name="ts_574660_577260_" > Tough. Depends how deep it goes.</a><a name="ts_577680_584500_" > I mean, some people are homophobic because of just lack of knowledge and not enough experience in the world.</a><a name="ts_584500_593660_" > That can be a pretty thin layer of homophobia that, with enough patience and time, it&#x27;s easy to break through.</a><a name="ts_593880_601030_" > When homophobia is deep-seated and steeped in like a certain kind of fear and bigotry,</a><a name="ts_601230_607690_" > I think part of it is patience and part of it is developing really good boundaries</a><a name="ts_607690_613610_" > and not letting the homophobic parent poison your life.</a><a name="ts_613610_615250_" > A Reddit user asks,</a><a name="ts_615430_619450_" > Is it common to just listen to your client and provide no insight?</a><a name="ts_619730_620330_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_620910_626350_" > Listening and helping a client understand what they&#x27;re going through</a><a name="ts_626350_633350_" > often involves spending a

it&#x27;s kind of useless.</a><a name="ts_640710_646530_" > It&#x27;s rare for us to be able to offer something that is really helpful to another person,</a><a name="ts_646550_648270_" > and it&#x27;s better to be quiet.</a><a name="ts_648510_650110_" > Mike Bain asks,</a><a name="ts_650370_655550_" > If all feelings are valid, then does validation essentially lose all meaning?</a><a name="ts_655790_660570_" > No. Validation is often a very good thing to offer another person.</a><a name="ts_660810_663650_" > People have a deep need to feel understood.</a><a

name="ts_672010_672930_" > They both matter.</a><a name="ts_673690_681110_" > So, the truth will be useless if a person is too upset or too hurt to deal with the truth.</a><a name="ts_681610_689130_"

I don&#x27;t mean that facts are important, but sometimes people argue or talk about facts</a><a name="ts_706130_709230_" > when they&#x27;re really trying to get to the truth of what matters to
