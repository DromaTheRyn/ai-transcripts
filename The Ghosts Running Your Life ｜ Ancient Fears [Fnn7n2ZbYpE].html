don&#x27;t want to hear.</a><a name="ts_11340_22020_" > Let me ask you something that, if you&#x27;re the kind of person who&#x27;s honest, should rattle your sense of reality just a little bit.</a><a name="ts_22120_25360_" > Who has actually been running your life?</a><a name="ts_25560_26880_" > It&#x27;s not you.</a><a name="ts_26880_32940_" > Every reaction you&#x27;ve had since childhood was pre-coded by ghosts.</a><a name="ts_33320_35740_" > And what I&#x27;m saying here isn&#x27;t a bunch of philosophy.</a><a name="ts_36100_37680_" > This is neuroscience.</a><a name="ts_38100_42630_" > The part of your brain that&#x27;s like the 911 operator is called the amygdala.</a><a name="ts_42790_46170_" > When it senses a threat, it does not call you.</a><a name="ts_46310_48470_" > And it floods your bloodstream with cortisol.</a><a name="ts_48590_55050_" > And it pulls these pre-loaded bullshit scripts from childhood trauma and ancestral memory.</a><a name="ts_55050_56570_" > You have a panic attack?</a><a name="ts_56750_61376_" > That is not modern-day, today&#x27;s stress in the moment.</a><a name="ts_61984_65310_" > That&#x27;s your mother&#x27;s anxious attachment style.</a><a name="ts_65330_69650_" > That&#x27;s your father&#x27;s frozen, contained rage.</a><a name="ts_69650_74490_" > It&#x27;s your great-grandmother&#x27;s fear of exile and shame.</a><a name="ts_74710_77270_" > It&#x27;s the six-year-old version of you.</a><a name="ts_77370_82570_" > The one that learned love or attention had to be earned.</a><a name="ts_82570_85490_" > That silence meant safety.</a><a name="ts_85490_86496_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_86496_93080_" > It&#x27;s the one that learned that approval was a currency that you needed to earn to survive.</a><a

I&#x27;m saying, nothing is theoretical.</a><a name="ts_131040_132700_" > This is neurological reality.</a><a name="ts_132880_138260_" > I don&#x27;t care what the guy with the sweater vest and the legal pad who told you to lay down on a couch said.</a><a name="ts_138260_146540_" > That is inherited hyper-vigilance from generations that survived a ton of serious wear.</a><a name="ts_146760_150420_" > War, exile, abandonment, and rejection.</a><a name="ts_150420_152096_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_152096_156440_" > And I think there&#x27;s a lot of people out there, maybe some

you choose authorship over obedience.</a><a name="ts_176970_181540_" > And you understand that you, you are not your triggers.</a><a name="ts_181540_187136_" > And you are not some ghost-written biography that people like to talk about all the time.</a><a name="ts_187936_192350_" > Every role that you play was assigned before you had a choice.</a><a name="ts_192350_195648_" > The audience that they&#x27;re performing for is gone.</a><a name="ts_196384_198410_" > The director of the movie is dead.</a><a name="ts_199328_204576_" > And you&#x27;re still at the center of that stage,

life.</a><a name="ts_226100_230592_" > The first thing that I will tell you is awareness is a weapon.</a><a name="ts_230592_232480_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_232480_234880_" > Do not trust your first emotion.</a><a name="ts_235456_239584_" > You have to question it and trace it and trace it back to the signal.</a><a name="ts_240224_243130_" > The next one is insert the pause.</a><a name="ts_243130_244320_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_244320_250970_" > So between the trigger and the reaction, that&#x27;s where your sovereignty lives.</a><a name="ts_251150_252930_" > In between those two things.</a><a name="ts_253070_259430_" > And you have to understand that my sovereignty resides in this moment between a trigger and a reaction.</a><a name="ts_259430_262170_" > The next thing is rewrite expectancy.</a><a name="ts_262650_265590_" > Your brain prepares for what it predicts.</a><a name="ts_265670_269990_" > So if you change your forecast, you change your future.</a><a name="ts_270290_273568_" > And finally, use the fate model.</a><a name="ts_274208_276830_" > That focus, authority, tribe, and emotion.</a><a name="ts_277190_280730_" > These are all four of your hijack points.</a><a name="ts_280730_283050_" > And you have to reclaim those.</a><a name="ts_283050_289824_" > Ask yourself in real time, in the moment, who does this reaction belong to?</a><a name="ts_290816_296290_" > Whose ghost script is this coming from?</a><a name="ts_296590_300090_" > Whose rules am I still obeying without realizing it?</a><a name="ts_300210_306330_" > It&#x27;s instantly going to help you understand that all of your reactions don&#x27;t necessarily belong to you.</a><a name="ts_306450_307370_" > It&#x27;s not a performance.</a><a name="ts_307370_310790_" > It&#x27;s not how to walk into a room and have the posture of confident people.</a><a name="ts_310910_311790_" > That is bullshit.</a><a name="ts_311790_314370_" > And it&#x27;s also not peak state.</a><a name="ts_314650_318250_" > Like you see in all these TikTok that pretend to have all these answers.</a><a name="ts_319010_323970_" > It is a surgical rebellion against your inherited limitations.</a><a name="ts_324110_325410_" > And it&#x27;s going to hurt.</a><a name="ts_325670_326890_" > It&#x27;s going to be uncomfortable.</a><a name="ts_327170_329610_" > And I don&#x27;t think you want this because you want more power.</a><a name="ts_329750_331610_" > And it&#x27;s definitely not to feel good.</a><a name="ts_331650_333130_" > It&#x27;s to get free.</a><a name="ts_333370_334690_" > It&#x27;s to become free.</a><a name="ts_334690_340120_" > And we all carry a memory that&#x27;s not logical.</a><a name="ts_340420_344020_" > It&#x27;s we carry biological and cellular memory.</a><a name="ts_344020_345216_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_345216_353610_" > And if there&#x27;s a chance that I did my job right, then something inside of you didn&#x27;t just hear what I said tonight.</a><a name="ts_353830_354720_" > You felt it.</a><a name="ts_354720_355936_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_355936_360430_" > And it&#x27;s not, I promise you, it&#x27;s not because what I was speaking was the truth.</a><a name="ts_360430_366752_" > It&#x27;s because my words shook something awake inside of you that was there already.</a><a name="ts_367360_368660_" > You did not learn this.</a><a name="ts_368660_370620_" > You remembered what I said.</a><a name="ts_371060_374860_" > And if you felt one of those little flinches, that was a recognition.</a><a name="ts_375160_380480_" > There&#x27;s a freaking part of you right now that&#x27;s been screaming from underneath a mask.</a><a name="ts_380520_382592_" > And it just sat up a little bit.</a><a name="ts_383392_389020_" > And I think most people are going to live never knowing that there is a massive difference between</a><a name="ts_389020_393930_" > something that is true and the truth itself.</a><a name="ts_394390_396410_" > Because we&#x27;re not learning truth.</a><a name="ts_396610_398208_" > Truth is something we remember.</a><a name="ts_398208_401088_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_401088_401824_" > You have a choice.</a><a name="ts_402496_405728_" > You burn that lie to the ground.</a><a name="ts_405728_407328_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_407328_410600_" > But you spend the rest of your life decorating a cage.</a><a name="ts_411392_417520_" > And forever, stop using the word me to define a bunch of ghosts.</a><a name="ts_417520_419980_" > Just let them be ghosts.</a><a name="ts_420800_423790_" > And take the effing wheel back in your life.</a><a name="ts_423930_424670_" > It&#x27;s yours.</a><a name="ts_424670_424770_" > I mean, I think it could not be never that bad encounter.</a><a name="ts_424810_424850_" > Well, let the news around 9-4 – dads say, hope you let them know.</a><a name="ts_424850_424890_" > Thank you.</a></p></div></body>
