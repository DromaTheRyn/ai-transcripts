charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver your opponents,</a><a name="ts_231170_232928_" > you will attain the heights of power.</a><a name="ts_232928_234048_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_234048_238208_" > You

playing power games,</a><a name="ts_249910_254848_" > no matter how indirect, seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past.</a><a name="ts_254848_256128_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_256128_259936_" > They believe they can opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with power.</a><a name="ts_259936_261376_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_261376_263200_" > You must beware of such people.</a><a

without any motive of self-interest,</a><a name="ts_286130_289350_" > would not publicize its weakness to gain sympathy or respect.</a><a name="ts_289350_290944_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_290944_294000_" > Making a show of one&#x27;s weakness is actually a very effective strategy,</a><a name="ts_294500_297184_" > subtle and deceptive, in the game of power.</a><a name="ts_297184_298656_" > (.)</a><a

confront the problem that some people do certain things better than others.</a><a name="ts_324440_326016_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_326016_328310_" > Treating everyone equally means ignoring their
