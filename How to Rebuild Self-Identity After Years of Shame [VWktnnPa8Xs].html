problem for most people with complex trauma, and that is they don&#x27;t know who they are.</a><a name="ts_12448_18310_S00" > I have had so many clients say to me, Tim, I&#x27;m 50 years old, I don&#x27;t have a clue who I am.</a><a name="ts_18430_29088_S00" > I have spent all my life fawning, wearing masks, adopting roles, being a chameleon, I don&#x27;t have a clue who I am.</a><a name="ts_29824_35190_S00" > So that is a huge challenge for people in recovery.</a><a name="ts_35410_42180_S00" > So let me just take that characteristic and kind of go to what do I do about it?</a><a name="ts_42320_47872_S00" > What&#x27;s the path forward in recovery to get to know who I am?</a><a name="ts_48704_58570_S00" > Because that&#x27;s really what we want to come out of these understanding these characteristics is, yeah, that&#x27;s an issue to be 50 years old and don&#x27;t have a clue who you are.</a><a name="ts_58950_60544_S00" > How do I change that?</a><a name="ts_60544_61856_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_61856_74112_S00" > So what I want you to think about is this, the child who&#x27;s in complex trauma, they&#x27;re wearing masks, they&#x27;re fawning, but more than that, they&#x27;re in survival mode.</a><a name="ts_74112_75264_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_75264_81090_S00" > And when a child&#x27;s in survival mode, the focus of their brain is surviving.</a><a name="ts_81090_87936_S00" > It&#x27;s not exploring, it&#x27;s not having fun, it&#x27;s not going, oh, I wonder what I like.</a><a name="ts_88672_90330_S00" > It&#x27;s how do I not get hurt?</a><a name="ts_90450_91744_S00" > How do I get my needs met?</a><a name="ts_92608_103090_S00" > So when it comes to the other thing for many children in complex trauma is they were expected to conform to being the hero child, being the invisible child,</a><a name="ts_103090_114304_S00" > being on a path to becoming a doctor or lawyer, to kind of fit the roles and jobs that the parents had decided the child should have.</a><a name="ts_114304_115584_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_115584_124736_S00" > So if they decided to pursue their interests or their passions, they got shut down for that, they got criticized for that, shamed for that.</a><a name="ts_125376_132550_S00" > So they weren&#x27;t allowed to explore, they weren&#x27;t allowed to pursue their passions on top of having to fawn and be a chameleon.</a><a name="ts_132550_141230_S00" > So how does a child normally, in a safe, healthy environment, get to know who they are?</a><a name="ts_141630_144950_S00" > And so this is so important to understand in recovery.</a><a name="ts_145250_149970_S00" > You first have to have safe people who aren&#x27;t going to judge you, a safe environment.</a><a name="ts_150370_152670_S00" > What does a child do in that safe environment?</a><a name="ts_152730_163290_S00" > They play, they explore, they&#x27;re curious, and they try hundreds of different things, all kinds of sports, all kinds of hobbies, all kinds of different interests.</a><a name="ts_163290_170590_S00" > One day they want to be a doctor, one day they want to be a fireman, one day they want to be a hockey player, they are trying all kinds of different things.</a><a name="ts_170850_176690_S00" > As they do that, without fear of judgment, they don&#x27;t even see failure as a problem.</a><a name="ts_176850_178370_S00" > That&#x27;s just part of all of this.</a><a name="ts_178810_185270_S00" > They get to realize what I&#x27;m good at, what my talents are, what my skills are, what connects to my deepest passions,</a><a name="ts_185490_191150_S00" > what connects to a life purpose that I want, that I didn&#x27;t even know I had.</a><a name="ts_191150_195776_S00" > And out of that, they begin to know who they are.</a><a name="ts_196416_199840_S00" > But think about that, that can take 20 years.</a><a name="ts_199840_201184_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_201184_209860_S00" > So if you come into recovery and you don&#x27;t have a clue who you are, don&#x27;t expect that you&#x27;re going to figure it out in a week or a month.</a><a name="ts_210656_213984_S00" > Give yourself lots of time to figure it out.</a><a name="ts_213984_215008_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_215008_224460_S00" > But then, with safe people in a safe, non-judgmental environment, begin to explore all kinds of hobbies, all kinds of interests.</a><a name="ts_224760_227780_S00" > Find out what you&#x27;re good at. Find out what your passion is.</a><a name="ts_227780_228832_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_228832_238190_S00" > So most people, after they go through our program, they begin to have a vague sense of who their authentic self is.</a><a name="ts_238190_242910_S00" > It&#x27;s kind of a fuzzy, blurry image, but they&#x27;re starting to get a vague sense.</a><a name="ts_242910_244416_S00" > (..)</a><a name="ts_244416_247330_S00" > Over the next years, they begin to try different things.</a><a name="ts_247550_249590_S00" > They volunteer in different places.</a><a name="ts_249590_251070_S00" > They try different hobbies.</a><a name="ts_251070_252128_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_252128_254700_S00" > And they get a clearer and clearer picture.</a><a name="ts_254700_256096_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_256096_259470_S00" > One of the things that helps many people is they can take a personality test.</a><a name="ts_259470_266610_S00" > They start to read different books that help people understand some of their desires, some of their talents.</a><a name="ts_266730_271648_S00" > And they begin to get a clearer and clearer picture of who they are.</a><a name="ts_272384_276550_S00" > So don&#x27;t beat yourself up that you might be 50 and don&#x27;t know yourself.</a><a name="ts_277376_279130_S00" > Just go, okay, this is where I&#x27;m at.</a><a name="ts_279410_288030_S00" > Now, I&#x27;m going to give myself permission to be a child and to begin to explore and to begin to try all kinds of different hobbies.</a><a name="ts_288030_294250_S00" > Now, for a lot of people, this triggers another part of complex trauma, which we&#x27;re going to get to later.</a><a name="ts_294250_296130_S00" > And that is fear of failure.</a><a name="ts_296370_300730_S00" > So they start a new hobby and they go, I need to do it perfectly the first time.</a><a name="ts_300890_301728_S00" > But they can&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_301728_302920_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_302920_304360_S00" > They&#x27;re uncoordinated.</a><a name="ts_304480_305160_S00" > They make mistakes.</a><a name="ts_305340_306560_S00" > It&#x27;s kind of awkward.</a><a name="ts_306560_308160_S00" > And they go, oh, I quit.</a><a name="ts_308960_310260_S00" > No, get through that.</a><a name="ts_310680_312880_S00" > Get past that fear of failure.</a><a name="ts_313120_315180_S00" > It takes time to learn.</a><a name="ts_315200_319180_S00" > And that&#x27;s a gradual process where things aren&#x27;t perfect the first time.</a><a name="ts_319180_324220_S00" > Then you start to get a clearer, clearer picture of who you are.</a><a name="ts_324720_334760_S00" > And once you do, that clarifying sense of self-identity as your shame is also healing is so wonderful.</a><a name="ts_334760_335808_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_335808_338070_S00" > Something inside changes.</a><a name="ts_338490_340190_S00" > Something inside feels lighter.</a><a name="ts_340610_343770_S00" > There&#x27;s a light there now that wasn&#x27;t there before.</a><a name="ts_343770_349440_S00" > Okay, let&#x27;s go to the next characteristic that comes out of shame.</a><a name="ts_350080_354860_S00" > And that is people with shame tend to judge themselves harshly.</a><a name="ts_355040_358120_S00" > They tend to be very hard on themselves.</a><a name="ts_358120_373880_S00" > So if you were to get inside their brain on any given day, you would hear hundreds of messages in their brain that are criticizing everything they do, that are putting themselves down in every situation.</a><a name="ts_373880_379480_S00" > And if they fail, then they beat themselves up royally.</a><a name="ts_379480_380896_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_380896_387392_S00" > Part of that is a belief that that&#x27;s how you motivate somebody to improve, is you put them down.</a><a name="ts_388000_389900_S00" > That comes out of their parenting.</a><a name="ts_390880_396010_S00" > Also, part of that comes out of if I fail, then I need to serve the time.</a><a name="ts_396310_397630_S00" > Justice needs to be done.</a><a name="ts_397850_400330_S00" > I need to be punished for my crime.</a><a name="ts_400470_408550_S00" > And I can&#x27;t be let out of jail till I&#x27;ve served the time, which is I got to beat myself down for a couple days.</a><a name="ts_408550_419940_S00" > So if we go back to our diagram, what you have with you hide the true self, you create these personas, then you have this internal critic.</a><a name="ts_420240_424180_S00" > Now, the internal critic is actually doing two things.</a><a name="ts_424220_431640_S00" > He is criticizing everything that you do because it doesn&#x27;t match the ideal self.</a><a name="ts_432100_434220_S00" > Oh, you could be better.</a><a name="ts_434400_437760_S00" > You could have been done that better if only you would like this.</a><a name="ts_437760_444200_S00" > So it&#x27;s constantly comparing the persona to the ideal self and constant failure.</a><a name="ts_444420_446528_S00" > So constant criticism.</a><a name="ts_447360_451270_S00" > But it&#x27;s also being critical by saying you&#x27;re fake.</a><a name="ts_451270_452608_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_452608_454070_S00" > This is a false persona.</a><a name="ts_454330_455790_S00" > This is not the true you.</a><a name="ts_456768_458700_S00" > You have imposter syndrome.</a><a name="ts_459100_463040_S00" > If people knew the true you, they would never love you.</a><a name="ts_463040_464064_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_464064_476096_S00" > And so this internal critic has constant fodder to feed the mill that basically says you&#x27;re phony and everything you do is never good enough.</a><a name="ts_476864_482330_S00" > And so this internal critic for most people with complex trauma is very loud.</a><a name="ts_482330_484030_S00" > It&#x27;s very constant.</a><a name="ts_484380_487610_S00" > And it just constantly feeds shame.</a><a name="ts_487610_490950_S00" > It constantly makes them feel even worse.</a><a name="ts_491210_497330_S00" > It constantly seems to confirm that negative identity that they aren&#x27;t good enough.</a><a name="ts_497330_498688_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_498688_502730_S00" > And so it becomes this loop that just feeds off itself.</a><a name="ts_503050_507090_S00" > Now, let me take you back to where some of this began.</a><a name="ts_507090_517270_S00" > So what happens for many children in complex trauma is they have parents who neglect them or they&#x27;re critical.</a><a name="ts_517290_518950_S00" > They abuse them.</a><a name="ts_519010_519550_S00" > They&#x27;re negative.</a><a name="ts_519550_520610_S00" > They find fault.</a><a name="ts_520830_523310_S00" > Whatever the child does doesn&#x27;t seem to be good enough.</a><a name="ts_523310_530610_S00" > They&#x27;re constantly sending verbal and nonverbal negative messages to the child.</a><a name="ts_530610_536700_S00" > So what is happening in the child&#x27;s brain is they&#x27;re absorbing those messages.</a><a name="ts_536700_544880_S00" > They&#x27;re believing those messages and they&#x27;re developing an internal parent in their brain, the IP.</a><a name="ts_545280_554080_S00" > That is basically parroting what their actual parents say and how they act toward them.</a><a name="ts_554220_555648_S00" > That&#x27;s basically shame.</a><a name="ts_556256_562190_S00" > And so that internal parent just expresses the shame belief.</a><a name="ts_562190_563232_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_563232_565130_S00" > But then there&#x27;s another piece to this.</a><a name="ts_565190_567760_S00" > And that is this usually happens gradually.</a><a name="ts_568590_570250_S00" > So let me give you an example.</a><a name="ts_570490_577830_S00" > So the child is crying and parents get frustrated with the crying and saying big boys don&#x27;t cry.</a><a name="ts_578110_579150_S00" > That&#x27;s so weak.</a><a name="ts_579370_580990_S00" > Go to your room and don&#x27;t come out to you.</a><a name="ts_581130_581610_S00" > Stop crying.</a><a name="ts_581730_584550_S00" > Or if you&#x27;re going to keep crying and punish you for give you something to cry about.</a><a name="ts_584550_588930_S00" > And so all of a sudden crying to them is such a weakness.</a><a name="ts_588930_592650_S00" > It causes them to get hurt and punished and shamed.</a><a name="ts_592870_599870_S00" > And so they hate that weak part of themselves that they&#x27;re so, that they cry so much, that they&#x27;re so sensitive.</a><a name="ts_600230_604450_S00" > And so now they go, I hate this part of myself.</a><a name="ts_605376_606750_S00" > Let&#x27;s lock it away.</a><a name="ts_607050_610300_S00" > Then they get told they&#x27;re too fat.</a><a name="ts_610620_613280_S00" > I hate that I&#x27;m fat.</a><a name="ts_613856_615040_S00" > I hate my body.</a><a name="ts_615040_618400_S00" > Then they get told that they&#x27;re too angry.</a><a name="ts_618620_620240_S00" > I hate that I&#x27;m too angry.</a><a name="ts_620480_621880_S00" > Then they get told they&#x27;re too sensitive.</a><a name="ts_622100_623720_S00" > I hate that I&#x27;m too sensitive.</a><a name="ts_623720_624768_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_624768_632800_S00" > So gradually, piece by piece of their personality, they develop a greater negativity towards it.</a><a name="ts_633568_634880_S00" > So now they hate their body.</a><a name="ts_634880_636200_S00" > They hate their personality.</a><a name="ts_636520_637480_S00" > They hate their emotions.</a><a name="ts_637800_638780_S00" > They hate their skills.</a><a name="ts_639380_648920_S00" > And they&#x27;re trying to hide more and more of themself and replace it with a mask that they think will gain them acceptance.</a><a name="ts_648920_653500_S00" > But there&#x27;s more and more of themself that they don&#x27;t like.</a><a name="ts_653500_654592_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_654592_658830_S00" > So shame just has grown gradually through childhood.</a><a name="ts_658830_667910_S00" > But also, the internal parent has found more and more things to be negative about in themself.</a><a name="ts_667910_671710_S00" > And that is what has happened inside a child.</a><a name="ts_671990_690176_S00" > What is so important to understand moving forward is there have been a whole bunch of tests that have been done to basically figure out what is it that is the best long-lasting motivation that brings about long-lasting change and growth in people.</a><a name="ts_690816_694320_S00" > For people from complex trauma, they thought it would be critical.</a><a name="ts_694660_695840_S00" > Shame the person.</a><a name="ts_696160_701500_S00" > And what they found is that that brought about some short-term improvement.</a><a name="ts_701600_709040_S00" > But if they kept getting criticized, if they kept getting shamed, after a while, it actually made things worse.</a><a name="ts_709300_710960_S00" > The child gave up growing.</a><a name="ts_711200_712120_S00" > They felt hopeless.</a><a name="ts_712120_713760_S00" > (..)</a><a name="ts_713760_719296_S00" > What brought about long-lasting growth and healing and change?</a><a name="ts_720064_721152_S00" > Self-compassion.</a><a name="ts_721888_731960_S00" > What I want you to understand is what is actually needed to grow is the exact opposite remedy that shame has produced.</a><a name="ts_732340_736860_S00" > Shame has produced shame and criticize and be hard on yourself.</a><a name="ts_736920_743740_S00" > When the actual remedy, the actual healthy solution is be kind to yourself.</a><a name="ts_743740_747950_S00" > To a person who&#x27;s always been hard on themself, that feels wrong.</a><a name="ts_748110_749250_S00" > That feels weak.</a><a name="ts_749390_752350_S00" > That feels like how can that produce any good results?</a><a name="ts_752350_757800_S00" > So you have to work through what feels very wrong.</a><a name="ts_757860_759300_S00" > It feels weird.</a><a name="ts_759480_760600_S00" > It feels awkward.</a><a name="ts_760600_762880_S00" > It feels like you&#x27;re being soft.</a><a name="ts_763280_766080_S00" > But that is the path to healing.</a><a name="ts_766080_767264_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_767264_767970_S00" > The next one.</a><a name="ts_768150_772550_S00" > That is shame basically says I don&#x27;t have value.</a><a name="ts_772750_775970_S00" > So I don&#x27;t want
