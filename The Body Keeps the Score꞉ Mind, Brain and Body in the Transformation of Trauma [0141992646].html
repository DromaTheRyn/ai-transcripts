They are soundless apparitions,</a><a name="ts_27010496_27017040_" > which speak to me by looks and gestures, wordless and silent. And their silence is precisely what</a><a name="ts_27017040_27029790_" > disturbs me. Eric Maria remarked from All Quiet on the Western Front. In the spring of 2002,</a><a name="ts_27029790_27035270_" > I was asked to examine a young man who claimed to have been sexually abused while growing up by Paul</a><a name="ts_27035270_27042780_" > Shanley, a Catholic priest who had served in his parish in Newton, Massachusetts. Now 25 years old,</a><a name="ts_27042960_27047600_" > he had apparently forgotten the abuse until he heard that the priest was currently under investigation</a><a name="ts_27048140_27055860_" > for molesting young boys. The question posed to me was, even though he had seemingly repressed</a><a name="ts_27055860_27061730_" > the abuse for well over a decade after it ended, were his memories credible? And was I</a><a name="ts_27061730_27069230_" > prepared to testify to that fact before a judge? I will share what this man, whom I&#x27;ll call Julian,</a><a name="ts_27069610_27074970_" > told me, drawing on my original case notes. Even though his real name is in the public record,</a><a name="ts_27075130_27081330_" > I&#x27;m using a pseudonym because I hope that he has regained some privacy and peace with the passage of</a><a name="ts_27081330_27090240_" > time. His experiences illustrate the complexities of traumatic memory. The controversies over the case</a><a name="ts_27090240_27095072_" > against Father Shanley are also typical of the passions that have swirled around this issue,</a><a name="ts_27095712_27100860_" > since psychiatrists first described the unusual nature of traumatic memories in the final decades</a><a name="ts_27100860_27113790_" > of the 19th century, flooded by sensations and images. On February 11, 2001, Julian was serving as</a><a name="ts_27113790_27119300_" > a military policeman at an Air Force base. During his daily phone conversation with his girlfriend,</a><a name="ts_27119520_27124880_" > Rachel, she mentioned a lead article she&#x27;d read that morning in the Boston Globe. A priest,</a><a name="ts_27124880_27131120_" > named Shanley, was under suspicion for molesting children. Hadn&#x27;t Julian once told her about a</a><a name="ts_27131120_27136400_" > Father Shanley who had been his parish priest back in Newton? Did he ever do anything to you,</a><a name="ts_27136520_27142910_" > she asked? Julian initially recalled Father Shanley as a kind man who had been very supportive</a><a name="ts_27142910_27150600_" > after his parents got divorced. But as the conversation went on, he started to go into a panic. He suddenly</a><a name="ts_27150600_27157560_" > saw Shanley silhouetted in a doorframe, his hands stretched out at 45 degrees, staring at Julian as he</a><a name="ts_27157560_27165040_" > urinated. Overwhelmed by emotion, he told Rachel, I&#x27;ve got to go. He called his flight chief, who</a><a name="ts_27165040_27170810_" > came over, accompanied by the first sergeant. After he met with the two of them, they took him to the</a><a name="ts_27170810_27178540_" > base chaplain. Julian recalls telling him, Do you know what is going on in Boston? It happened to me,</a><a name="ts_27178600_27184070_" > too. The moment he heard himself say those words, he knew for certain that Shanley had molested him,</a><a name="ts_27184430_27190528_" > even though he did not remember the details. Julian felt extremely embarrassed about being so emotional.</a><a name="ts_27191360_27197310_" > He had always been a strong kid who kept things to himself. That night, he sat on the corner of his</a><a name="ts_27197310_27203008_" > bed, hunched over, thinking he was losing his mind and terrified that he would be locked up.</a><a name="ts_27203008_27204928_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_27204928_27209950_" > Over the subsequent week, images kept flooding into his mind, and he was afraid of breaking down</a><a name="ts_27209950_27215950_" > completely. He thought about taking a knife and plunging it into his leg just to stop the mental</a><a name="ts_27215950_27222120_" > pictures. Then the panic attacks started to be accompanied by seizures, which he called epileptic fits.</a><a name="ts_27222120_27231170_" > He scratched his body until he bled. He constantly felt hot, sweaty, and agitated. Between panic</a><a name="ts_27231170_27238010_" > attacks, he felt like a zombie. He observed himself from a distance, as if what he was experiencing were</a><a name="ts_27238010_27244650_" > actually happening to somebody else. In April, he received an administrative discharge, just 10 days</a><a name="ts_27244650_27251488_" > short of being eligible to receive full benefits. When Julian entered my office almost a year later,</a><a name="ts_27252224_27258920_" > I saw a handsome, muscular guy who looked depressed and defeated. He told me immediately that he felt</a><a name="ts_27258920_27264640_" > terrible about having left the Air Force. He wanted to make it his career, and he&#x27;d always</a><a name="ts_27264640_27271050_" > received excellent evaluations. He loved the challenges and the teamwork, and he missed the</a><a name="ts_27271050_27278090_" > structure of the military lifestyle. Julian was born in a Boston suburb, the second oldest of five</a><a name="ts_27278090_27284370_" > children. His father left the family when Julian was about six because he could not tolerate living with</a><a name="ts_27284370_27291170_" > Julian&#x27;s emotionally labile mother. Julian and his father get along quite well, but he sometimes</a><a name="ts_27291170_27296630_" > reproaches his father for having worked too hard to support his family and for abandoning him to the care of his</a><a name="ts_27296630_27303648_" > unbalanced mother. Neither his parents nor any of his siblings has ever received psychiatric care,</a><a name="ts_27304288_27311900_" > or been involved with drugs. Julian was a popular athlete in high school. Although he had many friends,</a><a name="ts_27312120_27318930_" > he felt pretty bad about himself and covered up for being a poor student by drinking and partying. He feels</a><a name="ts_27318930_27325570_" > ashamed that he took advantage of his popularity and good looks by having sex with many girls. He mentioned</a><a name="ts_27325570_27333460_" > wanting to call several of them to apologize for how badly he treated them. He remembered always hating his</a><a name="ts_27333460_27339650_" > body. In high school, he took steroids to pump himself up and smoked marijuana almost every</a><a name="ts_27339650_27346390_" > day. He didn&#x27;t go to college, and after graduating from high school, he was virtually homeless for almost</a><a name="ts_27346390_27352610_" > a year because he could no longer stand living with his mother. He enlisted to try to get his life back</a><a name="ts_27352610_27360928_" > on track. Julian met Father Shanley at age six when he was taking a CCD catechism class at the parish church.</a><a name="ts_27360928_27362144_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_27362144_27367880_" > He remembered Father Shanley taking him out of the class for confession. Father Shanley rarely wore a</a><a name="ts_27367880_27374460_" > cassock, and Julian remembered the priest&#x27;s dark blue corduroy pants. They would go to a big room</a><a name="ts_27374460_27381330_" > with one chair facing another and a bench to kneel on. The chairs were covered with red, and there was</a><a name="ts_27381330_27389010_" > a red velvet cushion on the bench. They played cards, a game of war that turned into strip poker. Then he</a><a name="ts_27389010_27395510_" > remembered standing in front of a mirror in that room. Father Shanley made him bend over. He remembered</a><a name="ts_27395510_27401750_" > Father Shanley putting a finger into his anus. He does not think Shanley ever penetrated him with his penis,</a><a name="ts_27401750_27408030_" > but he believed that the priest fingered him on numerous occasions. Other than that,</a><a name="ts_27408130_27413824_" > his memories were quite incoherent and fragmentary. He had flashes of images of Shanley&#x27;s face and of</a><a name="ts_27414400_27421160_" > isolated incidents. Shanley standing in the door of the bathroom, the priest going down on his knees and</a><a name="ts_27421160_27428170_" > moving it around with his tongue. He could not say how old he was when that happened. He remembered the</a><a name="ts_27428170_27435790_" > priest telling him how to perform oral sex, but he did not remember actually doing it. He remembered</a><a name="ts_27435790_27442200_" > passing out pamphlets in church and then Father Shanley sitting next to him in a pew, fondling him with one hand,</a><a name="ts_27442200_27448352_" > and holding Julian&#x27;s hand on himself with the other. He remembered that as he grew older,</a><a name="ts_27448960_27455810_" > Father Shanley would pass close to him and caress his penis. Paul did not like it, but did not know</a><a name="ts_27455810_27461690_" > what to do to stop it. After all, he told me, Father Shanley was the closest thing to God in my</a><a name="ts_27461690_27468220_" > neighborhood. In addition to these memory fragments, traces of his sexual abuse were clearly being</a><a name="ts_27468220_27474910_" > activated and replayed. Sometimes, when he was having sex with his girlfriend, the priest&#x27;s image</a><a name="ts_27474910_27480850_" > popped into his head and, as he said, he would lose it. A week before I interviewed him,</a><a name="ts_27480850_27484512_" > his girlfriend had pushed a finger into his mouth and playfully said,</a><a name="ts_27485152_27490140_" > you give good head. Julian jumped up and screamed, if you ever say that again,</a><a name="ts_27490180_27497030_" > I&#x27;ll fucking kill you. Then, terrified, they both started to cry. This was followed by one of</a><a name="ts_27497030_27503200_" > Julian&#x27;s epileptic fits in which he curled up in a fetal position, shaking and whimpering like a baby.</a><a name="ts_27503200_27504832_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_27504832_27512630_" > While telling me this, Julian looked very small and very frightened. Julian alternated between feeling</a><a name="ts_27512630_27517920_" > sorry for the old man that Father Shanley had become and simply wanting to take him into a</a><a name="ts_27517920_27524370_" > room somewhere and kill him. He also spoke repeatedly of how ashamed he felt, how hard it was to admit</a><a name="ts_27524370_27531580_" > that he could not protect himself. Nobody fucks with me, and now I have to tell you this. His image</a><a name="ts_27531580_27539960_" > was of a big, tough Julian. How do we make sense of a story like Julian&#x27;s? Years of apparent</a><a name="ts_27539960_27545530_" > forgetting, followed by fragmented, disturbing images, dramatic physical symptoms, and sudden</a><a name="ts_27545530_27552700_" > reenactments. As a therapist treating people with a legacy of trauma, my primary concern is not to</a><a name="ts_27552700_27558180_" > determine exactly what happened to them, but to help them tolerate the sensations and emotions</a><a name="ts_27558800_27565910_" > and reactions they experience without being constantly hijacked by them. When the subject of</a><a name="ts_27565910_27573540_" > blame arises, the central issue that needs to be addressed is usually self-blame, accepting that the</a><a name="ts_27573540_27581000_" > trauma was not their fault, that it was not caused by some defect in themselves, and that no one could</a><a name="ts_27581000_27587870_" > ever have deserved what happened to them. Once a legal case is involved, however, determination of</a><a name="ts_27587870_27594460_" > culpability becomes primary, and with it the admissibility of evidence. I had previously examined</a><a name="ts_27594460_27598720_" > twelve people who had been sadistically abused as children in the Catholic orphanage in Burlington,</a><a name="ts_27598860_27605310_" > Vermont. They had come forward with many other claimants more than four decades later, and although</a><a name="ts_27605310_27610390_" > none had had any contact with the others until the first claim was filed, their abuse memories were</a><a name="ts_27610390_27617370_" > astonishingly similar. They all named the same names, and the particular abuses that each nun or priest</a><a name="ts_27617370_27623550_" > had committed—in the same rooms, with the same furniture, and as part of the same daily routines.</a><a name="ts_27623550_27625344_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_27625344_27629472_" > Most of them subsequently accepted an out-of-court settlement from the Vermont Diocese.</a><a name="ts_27629472_27630656_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_27630656_27635600_" > Before a case goes to trial, the judge holds a so-called Daubert hearing to set the standards for</a><a name="ts_27635600_27643630_" > expert testimony to be presented to the jury. In a 1996 case, I had convinced a federal circuit court judge</a><a name="ts_27643630_27649312_" > in Boston that it was common for traumatized people to lose all memories of the event in question,</a><a name="ts_27649856_27657040_" > only to regain access to them in bits and pieces at a much later date. The same standards would apply</a><a name="ts_27657040_27663410_" > in Julian&#x27;s case. While my report to his lawyer remains confidential, it was based on decades of</a><a name="ts_27663410_27668350_" > clinical experience and research on traumatic memory, including the work of some of the great pioneers</a><a name="ts_27668350_27681930_" > of modern psychiatry. Normal versus traumatic memory. We all know how fickle memory is. Our stories change</a><a name="ts_27681930_27688290_" > and are constantly revised and updated. When my brothers, sisters, and I talk about events in our</a><a name="ts_27688290_27693730_" > childhood, we always end up feeling that we grew up in different families. So many of our memories simply</a><a name="ts_27693730_27702550_" > do not match. Such autobiographical memories are not precise reflections of reality. They are stories we tell</a><a name="ts_27702550_27710656_" > to convey our personal take on our experience. The extraordinary capacity of the human mind to</a><a name="ts_27711296_27717270_" > rewrite memory is illustrated in the Grant study of adult development, which has systematically followed</a><a name="ts_27717270_27724910_" > the psychological and physical health of more than 200 Harvard men from their sophomore years of 1939 to</a><a name="ts_27724910_27732010_" > 1944 to the present. Of course, the designers of the study could not have anticipated that most of the</a><a name="ts_27732010_27737680_" > participants would go off to fight in World War II, but we can now track the evolution of their wartime memories.</a><a name="ts_27737680_27747296_" > The men were interviewed in detail about their war experiences in 1945-46 and again in 1989-1990.</a><a name="ts_27747296_27748672_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_27748672_27754150_" > Four and a half decades later, the majority gave very different accounts from the narratives recorded</a><a name="ts_27754150_27760570_" > in their immediate post-war interviews. With the passage of time, events had been bleached of their intense</a><a name="ts_27760570_27768630_" > horror. In contrast, those who had been traumatized and subsequently developed PTSD did not modify their</a><a name="ts_27768630_27776290_" > accounts. Their memories were preserved essentially intact 45 years after the war ended. Whether we</a><a name="ts_27776290_27782040_" > remember a particular event at all and how accurate our memories of it are largely depends on how</a><a name="ts_27782040_27789580_" > personally meaningful it was and how emotional we felt about it at the time. The key factor is our level</a><a name="ts_27789580_27797050_" > of arousal. We all have memories associated with particular people, songs, smells, and places</a><a name="ts_27797050_27804650_" > that stay with us for a long time. Most of us still have precise memories of where we were and what</a><a name="ts_27804650_27811240_" > we saw on Tuesday, September 11, 2001. But only a fraction of us recall anything in particular about</a><a name="ts_27811780_27819460_" > September 10th. Most day-to-day experience passes immediately into oblivion. On ordinary days,</a><a name="ts_27819480_27824780_" > we don&#x27;t have much to report when we come home in the evening. The mind works according to schemes,</a><a name="ts_27824780_27831150_" > or maps, and incidents that fall outside the established pattern are most likely to capture</a><a name="ts_27831150_27838430_" > our attention. If we get a raise or a friend tells us some exciting news, we will retain the details of</a><a name="ts_27838430_27846440_" > the moment, at least for a while. We remember insults and injuries best. The adrenaline that we secrete</a><a name="ts_27846440_27853130_" > to defend against potential threats helps to engrave those incidents into our minds. Even if the content</a><a name="ts_27853130_27861950_" > of the remark fades, our dislike for the person who made it usually persists. When something terrifying</a><a name="ts_27861950_27868330_" > happens, like seeing a child or a friend get hurt in an accident, we will retain an intense and</a><a name="ts_27868330_27874130_" > largely accurate memory of the event for a long time. As James McGaw and colleagues have shown,</a><a name="ts_27874590_27880520_" > the more adrenaline you secrete, the more precise your memory will be. But that is true only up to a</a><a name="ts_27880520_27887540_" > certain point. Confronted with horror, especially the horror of inescapable shock, this system becomes</a><a name="ts_27887540_27894110_" > overwhelmed and breaks down. Of course, we can&#x27;t monitor what happens during a traumatic experience,</a><a name="ts_27894130_27899030_" > but we can reactivate the trauma in the laboratory, as was done for the brain scans and</a><a name="ts_27899030_27906368_" > chapters 3 and 4. When memory traces of the original sounds, images, and sensations are reactivated,</a><a name="ts_27907136_27912680_" > the frontal lobe shuts down, including, as we&#x27;ve seen, the region necessary to put feelings into words,</a><a name="ts_27912820_27918800_" > the region that creates our sense of location and time, and the thalamus, which integrates the raw data</a><a name="ts_27918800_27926690_" > of incoming sensations. At this point, the emotional brain, which is not under conscious control and cannot</a><a name="ts_27926690_27934112_" > communicate in words, takes over. The emotional brain, that is the limbic area in the brain stem,</a><a name="ts_27934816_27941810_" > expresses its altered activation through changes in emotional arousal, body physiology, and muscular</a><a name="ts_27941810_27950430_" > action. Under ordinary conditions, these two memory systems, rational and emotional, collaborate to</a><a name="ts_27950430_27957740_" > produce an integrated response. But high arousal not only changes the balance between them, but also</a><a name="ts_27957740_27963424_" > disconnects other brain areas necessary for the proper storage and integration of incoming information,</a><a name="ts_27964128_27972240_" > such as the hippocampus and the thalamus. As a result, the imprints of traumatic experiences are organized</a><a name="ts_27972240_27979810_" > not as coherent logical narratives, but in fragmented sensory and emotional traces, images, sounds, and</a><a name="ts_27979810_27990030_" > physical sensations. Julian saw a man with outstretched arms, a pew, a staircase, a strip poker game. He felt a</a><a name="ts_27990030_28002450_" > sensation in his penis, a panicked sense of dread, but there was little or no story, uncovering the</a><a name="ts_28002450_28009880_" > secrets of trauma. In the late 19th century, when medicine first began the systematic study of mental</a><a name="ts_28009880_28017120_" > problems, the nature of traumatic memory was one of the central topics under discussion. In France and</a><a name="ts_28017120_28024460_" > England, a prodigious number of articles were published on a syndrome known as railway spine, a psychological</a><a name="ts_28024460_28032290_" > aftermath of railroad accidents that included loss of memory. The greatest advances, however, came in the study</a><a name="ts_28032290_28038830_" > of hysteria, a mental disorder characterized by emotional outbursts, susceptibility to suggestion,</a><a name="ts_28039744_28044512_" > and contractions and paralysis of the muscles that could not be explained by simple anatomy. Once</a><a name="ts_28044512_28046304_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_28046304_28052544_" > considered an affliction of unstable or malingering women, the name comes from the Greek word for womb,</a><a name="ts_28053440_28059150_" > hysteria now became a window into the mysteries of mind and body. The names of some of the greatest</a><a name="ts_28059150_28065952_" > pioneers in neurology and psychiatry, such as Jean-Martin Charcot, Pierre Genet, and Sigmund Freud,</a><a name="ts_28066752_28072200_" > are associated with the discovery that trauma is at the root of hysteria, particularly the trauma of</a><a name="ts_28072200_28079590_" > childhood sexual abuse. These early researchers referred to traumatic memories as pathogenic secrets</a><a name="ts_28079590_28085510_" > or mental parasites, because as much as the sufferers wanted to forget whatever had happened,</a><a name="ts_28086250_28091070_" > their memories kept forcing themselves into consciousness, trapping them in an ever-renewing</a><a name="ts_28091070_28098550_" > present of existential horror. The interest in hysteria was particularly strong in France and,</a><a name="ts_28098550_28105710_" > as so often happens, its roots lay in the politics of the day. Jean-Martin Charcot, who was widely</a><a name="ts_28105710_28111420_" > regarded as the father of neurology, and his pupils, such as Gilles de la Tourette, lent their names to</a><a name="ts_28111420_28119800_" > numerous neurological diseases, was also active in politics. After Emperor Napoleon III abdicated in 1870,</a><a name="ts_28119800_28125680_" > there was a struggle between the monarchists, the old order backed by the clergy, and the advocates of</a><a name="ts_28125680_28132610_" > the fledgling French Republic, who believed in science and in secular democracy. Charcot believed that</a><a name="ts_28132610_28138640_" > women would be a critical factor in this struggle, and his investigation of hysteria offered a scientific</a><a name="ts_28138640_28145728_" > explanation for phenomena such as demonic possession states, witchcraft, exorcism, and religious ecstasy.</a><a name="ts_28145728_28147232_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_28147232_28152010_" > Charcot conducted meticulous studies of the physiological and neurological correlates</a><a name="ts_28152010_28159104_" > of hysteria in both men and women, all of which emphasized embodied memory and a lack of language.</a><a name="ts_28159104_28160288_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_28160288_28167110_" > For example, in 1889, he published the case of a patient named Lelog, who developed paralysis of</a><a name="ts_28167110_28174030_" > the legs after being involved in a traffic accident with a horse-drawn cart. Although Lelog fell to the ground</a><a name="ts_28174030_28179690_" > and lost consciousness, his legs appeared unhurt, and there were no neurological signs that would</a><a name="ts_28179690_28185920_" > indicate a physical cause for his paralysis. Charcot discovered that just before Lelog passed out,</a><a name="ts_28186624_28192704_" > he saw the wheels of the cart approaching him and strongly believed he would be run over. He noted that</a><a name="ts_28193344_28198690_" > the patient does not preserve any recollection. Questions addressed to him upon this point</a><a name="ts_28198690_28205960_" > are attended with no result. He knows nothing or almost nothing. Like many other patients at the</a><a name="ts_28205960_28212000_" > Salpetriere, Lelog expressed his experience physically. Instead of remembering the accident,</a><a name="ts_28212000_28219930_" > he developed paralysis of his legs. But for me, the real hero of this story is Pierre Genet,</a><a name="ts_28220150_28225792_" > who helped Charcot establish a research laboratory devoted to the study of hysteria at the Salpetriere.</a><a name="ts_28225792_28227808_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_28227808_28233140_" > In 1889, the same year that the Eiffel Tower was built, Genet published the first book-length</a><a name="ts_28233140_28241730_" > scientific account of traumatic stress, L&#x27;Automatisme Psychologique. Genet proposed that at the root of what we now call</a><a name="ts_28241730_28249380_" > PTSD was the experience of vehement emotions or intense emotional arousal. This treatise explained that</a><a name="ts_28249380_28255620_" > after having been traumatized, people automatically keep repeating certain actions, emotions, and sensations</a><a name="ts_28255620_28262220_" > related to the trauma. And unlike Charcot, who was primarily interested in measuring and documenting</a><a name="ts_28262220_28267970_" > patients&#x27; physical symptoms, Genet spent untold hours talking with them, trying to discover what was</a><a name="ts_28267970_28274370_" > going on in their minds. Also, in contrast to Charcot, whose research focused on understanding</a><a name="ts_28274370_28281020_" > the phenomena of hysteria, Genet was first and foremost a clinician whose goal was to treat his</a><a name="ts_28281020_28287400_" > patients. And that is why I studied his case reports in detail and why he became one of my most important</a><a name="ts_28287400_28291840_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_28291840_28297750_" > teachers—amnesia, dissociation, and reenactment. Genet was the first to point out the difference between</a><a name="ts_28297750_28305140_" > narrative memory—the stories people tell about trauma—and traumatic memory itself. One of his case histories</a><a name="ts_28305140_28310690_" > was the story of Irene, a young woman who was hospitalized following her mother&#x27;s death from</a><a name="ts_28310690_28317090_" > tuberculosis. Irene had nursed her mother for many months while continuing to work outside the home</a><a name="ts_28317090_28323050_" > to support her alcoholic father and pay for her mother&#x27;s medical care. When her mother finally died,</a><a name="ts_28323170_28328640_" > Irene, exhausted from stress and lack of sleep, tried for several hours to revive the corpse,</a><a name="ts_28329312_28334180_" > calling out to her mother and trying to force medicine down her throat. At one point,</a><a name="ts_28334260_28339950_" > the lifeless body dropped off the bed while Irene&#x27;s drunken father lay passed out nearby. Even after her</a><a name="ts_28339950_28345590_" > aunt arrived and started preparing for burial, Irene&#x27;s denial persisted. She had to be persuaded</a><a name="ts_28345590_28350980_" > to attend the funeral, and she laughed throughout the service. A few weeks later, she was brought to</a><a name="ts_28350980_28357970_" > the Salpetriere, where Genet took over her case. In addition to amnesia for her mother&#x27;s death,</a><a name="ts_28358090_28364672_" > Irene suffered from another symptom. Several times a week, she would stare, trance-like, at an empty bed,</a><a name="ts_28365312_28371910_" > ignore whatever was going on around her, and begin to care for an imaginary person. She meticulously</a><a name="ts_28371910_28379280_" > reproduced, rather than remembered, the details of her mother&#x27;s death. Traumatized people</a><a name="ts_28379280_28385860_" > simultaneously remember too little and too much. On the one hand, Irene had no conscious memory of</a><a name="ts_28385860_28391180_" > her mother&#x27;s death. She could not tell the story of what had happened. On the other, she was compelled</a><a name="ts_28391180_28397850_" > to physically act out the events of her mother&#x27;s death. Genet&#x27;s term, automatism, conveys the involuntary,</a><a name="ts_28398270_28405430_" > unconscious nature of her actions. Genet treated Irene for several months, mainly with hypnosis. At the end,</a><a name="ts_28405430_28409728_" > he asked her again about her mother&#x27;s death. Irene started to cry and said,</a><a name="ts_28410272_28414960_" > Don&#x27;t remind me of those terrible things. My mother was dead and my father was a complete drunk,</a><a name="ts_28415140_28421560_" > as always. I had to take care of her dead body all night long. I did a lot of silly things in order</a><a name="ts_28421560_28430290_" > to revive her. In the morning, I lost my mind. Not only was Irene able to tell the story,</a><a name="ts_28430490_28438730_" > but she had also recovered her emotions. I feel very sad and abandoned. Genet now called her memory</a><a name="ts_28438730_28446910_" > complete because it now was accompanied by the appropriate feelings. Genet noted significant</a><a name="ts_28446910_28452780_" > differences between ordinary and traumatic memory. Traumatic memories are precipitated by</a><a name="ts_28452780_28460510_" > specific triggers. In Julian&#x27;s case, the trigger was his girlfriend&#x27;s seductive comments. In Irene&#x27;s,</a><a name="ts_28460570_28466580_" > it was a bed. When one element of a traumatic experience is triggered, other elements are likely</a><a name="ts_28466580_28474600_" > to automatically follow. Traumatic memory is not condensed. It took Irene three to four hours to reenact</a><a name="ts_28474600_28479488_" > her story. But when she was finally able to tell what had happened, it took less than a minute.</a><a name="ts_28479488_28480800_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_28480800_28488490_" > The traumatic enactment serves no function. In contrast, ordinary memory is adaptive. Our stories</a><a name="ts_28488490_28494060_" > are flexible and can be modified to fit the circumstances. Ordinary memory is essentially</a><a name="ts_28494060_28500930_" > social. It&#x27;s a story that we tell for a purpose. In Irene&#x27;s case, to enlist her doctor&#x27;s help and</a><a name="ts_28500930_28508970_" > comfort. In Julian&#x27;s case, to recruit me to join his search for justice and revenge. But there is nothing</a><a name="ts_28508970_28515430_" > social about traumatic memory. Julian&#x27;s rage at his girlfriend&#x27;s remarks served no useful purpose.</a><a name="ts_28515430_28516832_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_28516832_28524460_" > Reenactments are frozen in time, unchanging, and they are always lonely, humiliating, and alienating</a><a name="ts_28524460_28531890_" > experiences. Janais coined the term dissociation to describe the splitting off and isolation of memory</a><a name="ts_28531890_28538390_" > imprints that he saw in his patients. He was also prescient about the heavy cost of keeping these traumatic</a><a name="ts_28538390_28543350_" > memories at bay. He later wrote that when patients dissociate their traumatic experience,</a><a name="ts_28543670_28550150_" > they become attached to an insurmountable obstacle. Unable to integrate their traumatic memories,</a><a name="ts_28550150_28555970_" > they seem to lose their capacity to assimilate new experiences as well. It is as if their</a><a name="ts_28555970_28561530_" > personality has definitely stopped at a certain point and cannot enlarge anymore by the addition</a><a name="ts_28561530_28567850_" > or assimilation of new elements. He predicted that unless they become aware of the split-off elements</a><a name="ts_28567850_28573760_" > and integrated them into a story that had happened in the past but was now over, they would experience</a><a name="ts_28573760_28579980_" > a slow decline in their personal and professional functioning. This phenomenon has now been well-documented</a><a name="ts_28579980_28586690_" > in contemporary research. Janais discovered that while it is normal to change and distort</a><a name="ts_28586690_28593100_" > one&#x27;s memories, people with PTSD are unable to put the actual event, the source of those memories,</a><a name="ts_28593280_28599190_" > behind them. Dissociation prevents the trauma from becoming integrated within the conglomerated,</a><a name="ts_28599570_28607630_" > ever-shifting stories of autobiographical memory, in essence creating a dual memory system. Normal memory</a><a name="ts_28607630_28613610_" > integrates the elements of each experience into the continuous flow of self-experience by a complex</a><a name="ts_28613610_28620270_" > process of association. Think of a dense but flexible network where each element exerts a subtle</a><a name="ts_28620270_28626688_" > influence on many others. But in Julian&#x27;s case, the sensations, thoughts, and emotions of the trauma</a><a name="ts_28627488_28636512_" > were stored separately as frozen, barely comprehensible fragments. If the problem with PTSD is dissociation,</a><a name="ts_28637312_28642592_" > the goal of treatment would be association.

Psychoanalysis was born on the wards of the Salpetriere. In 1885,</a><a name="ts_28663460_28667870_" > Freud went to Paris to work with Charcot, and he later named his first-born son,</a><a name="ts_28668330_28675550_" > Jean-Martin, in Charcot&#x27;s honor. In 1893, Freud and his Viennese mentor, Joseph Broyer,</a><a name="ts_28676130_28680576_" > cited both Charcot and Genet in a brilliant paper on the cause of hysteria.</a><a name="ts_28680576_28682016_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_28682016_28688270_" > Hysterics suffer mainly from reminiscences, they proclaimed, and go on to note that these memories</a><a name="ts_28688270_28694350_" > are not subject to the wearing-away process of normal memories, but persist for a long time with</a><a name="ts_28694350_28700384_" > astonishing freshness. Nor can traumatized people control when they will emerge. They wrote,</a><a name="ts_28701152_28707410_" > We must mention another remarkable fact, namely, that these memories, unlike other memories of their past</a><a name="ts_28707410_28713240_" > lives, are not at the patient&#x27;s disposal. On the contrary, these experiences are completely</a><a name="ts_28713240_28719520_" > absent from the patient&#x27;s memory when they are in a normal, psychical state, and are only present</a><a name="ts_28719520_28726320_" > in a highly summary form. Broyer and Freud believed that traumatic memories were lost to ordinary</a><a name="ts_28726320_28732300_" > consciousness, either because circumstances made a reaction impossible, or because they started during</a><a name="ts_28732300_28740410_" > severely paralyzing effects such as fright. In 1896, Freud boldly claimed that the ultimate cause</a><a name="ts_28740410_28747530_" > of hysteria is always the seduction of the child by an adult. Then, faced with his own evidence of an</a><a name="ts_28747530_28753312_" > epidemic of abuse in the best families of Vienna, one, he noted, that would implicate his own father,</a><a name="ts_28754144_28761760_" > he quickly began to retreat. Psychoanalysis shifted to an emphasis on unconscious wishes and fantasies,</a><a name="ts_28762368_28769550_" > though Freud occasionally kept acknowledging the reality of sexual abuse. After the horrors of World War</a><a name="ts_28769550_28775710_" > one confronted him with the reality of combat neuroses, Freud reaffirmed that lack of verbal</a><a name="ts_28775710_28783456_" > memory is central in trauma, and that if a person does not remember, he is likely to act out. He wrote,</a><a name="ts_28784352_28789330_" > He reproduces it not as a memory, but as an action. He repeats it, without knowing, of course,</a><a name="ts_28789490_28796510_" > that he is repeating. And in the end, we understand that this is his way of remembering. The lasting legacy</a><a name="ts_28796510_28806010_" > of Broyer and Freud&#x27;s 1893 paper is what we now call the talking cure. We found, to our great surprise</a><a name="ts_28806010_28812570_" > at first, that each individual hysterical symptom immediately and permanently disappeared when we</a><a name="ts_28812570_28817216_" > had succeeded in bringing clearly to light the memory of the event by which it was provoked and</a><a name="ts_28817856_28823440_" > in arousing its accompanying effect, when the patient had described that event in the greatest possible</a><a name="ts_28823440_28832256_" > detail and had put the effect into words.

In February 2005, the former priest was found guilty</a><a name="ts_29033250_29040800_" > on two counts of raping a child and two counts of assault and battery on a child. He was sentenced to 12 to 15</a><a name="ts_29040800_29048352_" > years in prison. In 2007, Shanley&#x27;s attorney, Robert F. Shaw Jr., filed a motion for a new trial,</a><a name="ts_29048960_29054270_" > challenging Shanley&#x27;s convictions as a miscarriage of justice. Shaw tried to make the case that</a><a name="ts_29054270_29060240_" > repressed memories were not generally accepted in the scientific community, that the convictions were</a><a name="ts_29060240_29065430_" > based on junk science, and that there had been insufficient testimony about the scientific status</a><a name="ts_29065430_29072070_" > of repressed memories before the trial. The appeal was rejected by the original trial judge, but</a><a name="ts_29072070_29078570_" > two years later was taken up by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts. Almost 100 leading</a><a name="ts_29078570_29084670_" > psychiatrists and psychologists from around the United States and eight foreign countries signed an</a><a name="ts_29084670_29091140_" > amicus curiae brief stating that repressed memory has never been shown to exist and that it should not</a><a name="ts_29091140_29098620_" > have been admitted as evidence. However, on January 10, 2010, the court unanimously upheld Shanley&#x27;s conviction</a><a name="ts_29098620_29105670_" > with this statement. In sum, the judge&#x27;s finding that the lack of scientific testing did not make</a><a name="ts_29105670_29111470_" > unreliable the theory that an individual may experience dissociative amnesia was supported in</a><a name="ts_29111470_29116608_" > the record.

However, what doctors encounter in emergency rooms,</a><a name="ts_30532992_30538440_" > on psychiatric wards, and on the battlefield, is necessarily quite different from what scientists observe</a><a name="ts_30538440_30547760_" > in their safe and well-organized laboratories. Consider what is known as the lost in the mall experiment,</a><a name="ts_30547840_30555040_" > for example. Academic researchers have shown that it is relatively easy to implant memories of events that</a><a name="ts_30555040_30563430_" > never took place, such as having been lost in a shopping mall as a child. About 25% of subjects in these studies</a><a name="ts_30563430_30570280_" > later recall that they were frightened and even fill in missing details.

Subjects might be shown a video of a car driving</a><a name="ts_30583900_30591430_" > down a street and asked afterward if they saw a stop sign or a traffic light. Children might be asked to recall</a><a name="ts_30591430_30597750_" > what a male visitor to their classroom had been wearing.

We can study the effects of</a><a name="ts_30632700_30639460_" > existing traumas in the lab as in our script-driven imaging studies of flashbacks, but the original</a><a name="ts_30639460_30646340_" > imprint of trauma cannot be laid down there. Dr. Roger Pittman conducted a study at Harvard in which he</a><a name="ts_30646340_30653520_" > showed college students a film called Faces of Death, which contained newsreel footage of violent deaths</a><a name="ts_30653520_30660608_" > and executions.

If you want to study traumatic</a><a name="ts_30667880_30675380_" > memory, you have to study the memories of people who have actually been traumatized. Interestingly,</a><a name="ts_30675740_30682590_" > once the excitement and profitability of courtroom testimony diminished, the scientific controversy</a><a name="ts_30682590_30692610_" > disappeared as well, and clinicians were left to deal with the wreckage of traumatic memory.

And I had previously testified on</a><a name="ts_31359970_31366030_" > behalf of several people who were traumatized by the experience. Nancy, however, did not want to sue</a><a name="ts_31366030_31372270_" > her surgeon or anesthetist. Her entire focus was on bringing the reality of her trauma to consciousness</a><a name="ts_31372270_31379560_" > so that she could free herself from its intrusions into her everyday life. I&#x27;d like to end this chapter</a><a name="ts_31379560_31385370_" > by sharing several passages from a remarkable series of emails in which she described her grueling journey</a><a name="ts_31385370_31394400_" > to recovery. Initially, Nancy did not know what had happened to her. When we went home, I was still in a</a><a name="ts_31394400_31400660_" > daze, doing the typical things of running a household, yet not really feeling that I was alive or that I was</a><a name="ts_31400660_31407648_" > real. I had trouble sleeping that night. For days, I remained in my own little disconnected world. I</a><a name="ts_31408640_31414580_" > could not use a hair dryer, toaster, stove, or anything that warmed up. I could not concentrate</a><a name="ts_31414580_31422300_" > on what people were doing or telling me. I just didn&#x27;t care. I was increasingly anxious. I slept less</a><a name="ts_31422300_31427840_" > and less. I knew I was behaving strangely and kept trying to understand what was frightening me so.</a><a name="ts_31427840_31429504_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_31429504_31434540_" > On the fourth night after the surgery, around 3am, I started to realize that the dream I had been</a><a name="ts_31434540_31441480_" > living all this time related to conversations I had heard in the operating room. I was suddenly</a><a name="ts_31441480_31447860_" > transported back into the OR. I could feel my paralyzed body being burned. I was engulfed in</a><a name="ts_31447860_31457056_" > a world of terror and horror. From then on, Nancy says, memories and flashbacks erupted into her life.</a><a name="ts_31457056_31458976_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_31458976_31464290_" > It was as if the door was pushed open slightly, allowing the intrusion. There was a mixture of</a><a name="ts_31464290_31472930_" > curiosity and avoidance. I continued to have irrational fears. I was deathly afraid of sleep. I experienced a</a><a name="ts_31472930_31478590_" > sense of terror when seeing the color blue. My husband, unfortunately, was bearing the brunt of</a><a name="ts_31478590_31485120_" > my illness. I would lash out at him when I truly did not intend to. I was sleeping at most two to three</a><a name="ts_31485120_31491616_" > hours, and my daytime was filled with hours of flashbacks. I remained chronically hyper-alert,</a><a name="ts_31492416_31498464_" > feeling threatened by my own thoughts and wanting to escape them. I lost 23 pounds in three weeks.</a><a name="ts_31499392_31506070_" > People kept commenting on how great I looked. I began to think about dying. I developed a very distorted</a><a name="ts_31506070_31510624_" > view of my life in which all my successes diminished and old failures were amplified. I was</a><a name="ts_31510624_31511744_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_31511744_31517180_" > hurting my husband and found that I could not protect my children from my rage. Three weeks</a><a name="ts_31517180_31522390_" > after the surgery, I went back to work at the hospital. The first time I saw somebody in a</a><a name="ts_31522390_31527616_" > surgical scrub suit was in the elevator. I wanted to get out immediately, but of course I could not.</a><a name="ts_31527616_31528736_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_31528736_31533888_" > I then had this irrational urge to clobber him, which I contained with considerable effort.</a><a name="ts_31533888_31535520_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_31535520_31542528_" > This episode triggered increasing flashbacks, terror, and dissociation. I cried all the way home from work.</a><a name="ts_31542528_31543680_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_31543680_31549070_" > After that, I became adept at avoidance. I never set foot in an elevator. I never went to the</a><a name="ts_31549070_31556630_" > cafeteria. I avoided the surgical floors. Gradually, Nancy was able to piece together</a><a name="ts_31556630_31564120_" > her flashbacks and create an understandable, if horrifying, memory of her surgery. She recalled</a><a name="ts_31564120_31570690_" > the reassurances of the OR nurses and a brief period of sleep after the anesthesia was started. Then she</a><a name="ts_31570690_31578250_" > remembered how she began to awaken. The entire team was laughing about an affair one of the nurses</a><a name="ts_31578250_31584864_" > was having. This coincided with the first surgical incision. I felt the stab of the scalpel,</a><a name="ts_31585504_31591860_" > then the cutting, then the warm blood flowing over my skin. I tried desperately to move, to speak,</a><a name="ts_31592768_31599370_" > but my body didn&#x27;t work. I couldn&#x27;t understand this. I felt a deeper pain as the layers of muscle</a><a name="ts_31599370_31608080_" > pulled apart under their own tension. I knew I wasn&#x27;t supposed to feel this. Nancy next recalls someone</a><a name="ts_31608080_31614304_" > rummaging around in her belly and identified this as the laparoscopic instruments being placed.</a><a name="ts_31614304_31615872_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_31615872_31621380_" > She felt her left tube being clamped. Then suddenly there was an intense searing, burning pain.</a><a name="ts_31621380_31628100_" > I tried to escape, but the cautery tip pursued me, relentlessly burning through. There simply are</a><a name="ts_31628100_31633610_" > no words to describe the terror of this experience. This pain is not in the same realm as other pain</a><a name="ts_31633610_31640896_" > I had known and conquered, like a broken bone or natural childbirth. It begins as extreme pain,</a><a name="ts_31641536_31647968_" > then continues relentlessly as it slowly burns through the tube. The pain of being cut with a scalpel</a><a name="ts_31648608_31657700_" > hails by this giant. Then, abruptly, the right tube felt the initial impact of the burning tip. When I heard</a><a name="ts_31657700_31663328_" > them laugh, I briefly lost track of where I was. I believed I was in a torture chamber,</a><a name="ts_31663904_31669290_" > and I could not understand why they were torturing me without even asking for information. My world</a><a name="ts_31669290_31675712_" > narrowed to a small sphere around the operating table. There was no sense of time, no past,</a><a name="ts_31676288_31684576_" > and no future. There was only pain, terror, and horror. I felt isolated from all humanity,</a><a name="ts_31685344_31691750_" > profoundly alone in spite of the people surrounding me. The sphere was closing in on me. In my agony,</a><a name="ts_31691870_31697504_" > I must have made some movement. I heard the nurse anesthetist tell the anesthesiologist that I was light.</a><a name="ts_31697504_31698560_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_31698560_31703328_" > He ordered more meds and then quietly said, there&#x27;s no need to put any of this in the chart.</a><a name="ts_31703328_31704640_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_31704640_31710960_" > That is the last memory I recalled. In her later emails to me, Nancy struggled to capture the</a><a name="ts_31710960_31718870_" > existential reality of trauma. I want to tell you what a flashback is like. It is as if time</a><a name="ts_31718870_31726070_" > is folded or warped so that the past and present merge, as if I were physically transported into the</a><a name="ts_31726070_31733400_" > past. Symbols related to the original trauma, however benign in reality, are thoroughly contaminated</a><a name="ts_31733400_31741710_" > and so become objects to be hated, feared, destroyed if possible, avoided if not. For example,</a><a name="ts_31742350_31751520_" > an iron in any form, a toy, a clothes iron, a curling iron, can be seen as an instrument of torture.</a><a name="ts_31751520_31753152_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_31753152_31758640_" > Each encounter with a scrub suit left me dissociated, confused, physically ill, and at times consciously</a><a name="ts_31758640_31766130_" > angry. My marriage is slowly falling apart. My husband came to represent the heartless,</a><a name="ts_31766310_31773970_" > laughing people, the surgical team who hurt me. I exist in a dual state. A pervasive numbness covers me with a</a><a name="ts_31773970_31780768_" > blanket, and yet the touch of a small child pulls me back to the world. For a moment I am present,</a><a name="ts_31781344_31788710_" > and a part of life, not just an observer. Interestingly, I function very well at work,</a><a name="ts_31788790_31797020_" > and am constantly given positive feedback. Life recedes with its own sense of falsity. There is a</a><a name="ts_31797020_31804710_" > strangeness, bizarreness to this dual existence. I tire of it, yet I cannot give up on life, and I cannot</a><a name="ts_31804710_31812230_" > delude myself into believing that if I ignore the beast, it will go away. I&#x27;ve thought many times that I</a><a name="ts_31812230_31819090_" > had recalled all the events around the surgery, only to find a new one. There are so many pieces</a><a name="ts_31819090_31824990_" > of that 45 minutes of my life that remain unknown. My memories are still incomplete and fragmented,</a><a name="ts_31824990_31831740_" > but I no longer think that I need to know everything in order to understand what happened. When the fear</a><a name="ts_31831740_31839680_" > subsides, I realize I can handle it, but a part of me doubts that I can. The pull to the past is strong,</a><a name="ts_31840448_31846190_" > it is the dark side of my life, and I must dwell there from time to time. The struggle may also be a</a><a name="ts_31846190_31851584_" > way to know that I survive, a replaying of the fight to survive, which apparently I won,</a><a name="ts_31852224_31859670_" > but cannot own. An early sign of recovery came when Nancy needed another, more extensive operation.</a><a name="ts_31859670_31861088_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_31861088_31865810_" > She chose a Boston hospital for the surgery, asked for a preoperative meeting with the surgeons</a><a name="ts_31865810_31872040_" > and the anesthesiologist specifically to discuss her prior experience, and requested that I be allowed</a><a name="ts_31872040_31877500_" > to join them in the operating room. For the first time in many years, I put on a surgical scrub</a><a name="ts_31877500_31882940_" > suit and accompanied her into the OR while the anesthesia was induced. This time,</a><a name="ts_31882940_31888810_" > she woke up to a feeling of safety. Two years later, I wrote Nancy asking her permission to</a><a name="ts_31888810_31894450_" > use her account of anesthesia awareness in this chapter. In her reply, she updated me on the</a><a name="ts_31894450_31901170_" > progress of her recovery. I wish I could say that the surgery to which you were so kind to accompany me</a><a name="ts_31901170_31908270_" > ended my suffering. That, sadly, was not the case.

In order to regain</a><a name="ts_32247760_32255280_" > control over yourself, you need to revisit the trauma. Sooner or later, you need to confront what has happened to you,</a><a name="ts_32255280_32263110_" > but only after you feel safe and will not be re-traumatized by it. The first order of</a><a name="ts_32263110_32269190_" > business is to find ways to cope with feeling overwhelmed by the sensations and emotions associated</a><a name="ts_32269190_32276360_" > with the past. As the previous parts of this book have shown, the engines of post-traumatic reactions are</a><a name="ts_32276360_32283648_" > located in the emotional brain.

The rational executive brain is good at</a><a name="ts_32315470_32321170_" > helping us understand where feelings come from. As in, I get scared when I get close to a guy because my</a><a name="ts_32321170_32326500_" > father molested me. Or, I have trouble expressing my love toward my son because I feel guilty about</a><a name="ts_32326500_32334210_" > having killed a child in Iraq. However, the rational brain cannot abolish emotions, sensations,</a><a name="ts_32334470_32340990_" > or thoughts, such as living with a low-level sense of threat or feeling that you are fundamentally a</a><a name="ts_32340990_32345824_" > terrible person even though you rationally know that you are not to blame for having been raped.</a><a name="ts_32345824_32347680_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_32347680_32353920_" > Understanding why you feel a certain way does not change how you feel, but it can keep you from</a><a name="ts_32353920_32360800_" > surrendering to intense reactions.

Our thinking</a><a name="ts_32420310_32426930_" > becomes sluggish, and we have trouble getting out of our chairs.

The neuroscientist Joseph Ledoux and his colleagues have shown that the only way we can</a><a name="ts_32485570_32491590_" > consciously access the emotional brain is through self-awareness — that is, by activating the medial</a><a name="ts_32491590_32498570_" > prefrontal cortex — the part of the brain that notices what is going on inside us and thus allows us to feel that</a><a name="ts_32498570_32505820_" > we&#x27;re feeling. The technical term for this is interoception, which comes from the Latin for</a><a name="ts_32505820_32511968_" > looking inside.

However, that does not help us manage</a><a name="ts_32518680_32526120_" > ourselves.

I&#x27;ll discuss drugs later in</a><a name="ts_32556370_32562320_" > this chapter, but first I need to stress the fact that we have a host of in-built skills to keep us on</a><a name="ts_32562320_32572560_" > an even keel. In chapter 5, we saw how emotions are registered in the body. Some 80% of the fibers of the</a><a name="ts_32572560_32579800_" > internal organs are afferent. That is, they run from the body into the brain. This means that we</a><a name="ts_32579800_32585840_" > can directly train our arousal system by the way we breathe, chant, and move. A principle that has been</a><a name="ts_32585840_32592280_" > utilized since time immemorial in places like China and India and in every religious practice that I know</a><a name="ts_32592280_32601860_" > of, but that is suspiciously eyed as alternative in mainstream culture. In research supported by</a><a name="ts_32601860_32606720_" > the National Institutes of Health, my colleagues and I have shown that 10 weeks of yoga practice</a><a name="ts_32606720_32613520_" > markedly reduced the PTSD symptoms of patients who had failed to respond to any medication or to any</a><a name="ts_32613520_32623180_" > other treatment. I&#x27;ll discuss yoga in chapter 16. Neurofeedback, the topic of chapter 19, also can be</a><a name="ts_32623180_32628576_" > particularly effective for children and adults who are so hyper-aroused or shut down that they</a><a name="ts_32629280_32637940_" > have trouble focusing and prioritizing. Learning how to breathe calmly and remaining in a state of</a><a name="ts_32637940_32644520_" > relative physical relaxation, even while accessing painful and horrifying memories, is an essential</a><a name="ts_32644520_32652460_" > tool for recovery. When you deliberately take a few slow, deep breaths, you will notice the effects</a><a name="ts_32652460_32659540_" > of the parasympathetic break on your arousal, as explained in chapter 5. The more you stay focused on</a><a name="ts_32659540_32664810_" > your breathing, the more you will benefit, particularly if you pay attention until the very</a><a name="ts_32664810_32672930_" > end of the out-breath and then wait a moment before you inhale again. As you continue to breathe and</a><a name="ts_32672930_32677230_" > notice the air moving in and out of your lungs, you may think about the role that oxygen plays in</a><a name="ts_32677230_32683072_" > nourishing your body and bathing your tissues with the energy you need to feel alive and engaged.</a><a name="ts_32683072_32684224_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_32684224_32693110_" > Chapter 16 documents the full-body effects of this simple practice. Since emotional regulation is the</a><a name="ts_32693110_32697970_" > critical issue in managing the effects of trauma and neglect, it would make an enormous difference</a><a name="ts_32697970_32704470_" > if teachers, army sergeants, foster parents, and mental health professionals were thoroughly schooled</a><a name="ts_32704470_32712140_" > in emotional regulation techniques.

At the core of recovery is self-awareness. The most important</a><a name="ts_32800950_32811090_" > phrases in trauma therapy are, notice that, and what happens next. Traumatized people live with seemingly</a><a name="ts_32811090_32818040_" > unbearable sensations. They feel heartbroken and suffer from intolerable sensations in the pit of their</a><a name="ts_32818040_32825240_" > stomach or tightness in their chest. Yet, avoiding feeling these sensations in our bodies increases our</a><a name="ts_32825240_32831390_" > vulnerability to being overwhelmed by them. Body awareness puts us in touch with our inner world,</a><a name="ts_32831390_32838600_" > the landscape of our organism. Simply noticing our annoyance, nervousness, or anxiety immediately</a><a name="ts_32838600_32845420_" > helps us shift our perspective and opens up new options other than our automatic, habitual reactions.</a><a name="ts_32845420_32847616_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_32847616_32853410_" > Mindfulness puts us in touch with the transitory nature of our feelings and perceptions. When we pay</a><a name="ts_32853410_32859290_" > focused attention to our bodily sensations, we can recognize the ebb and flow of our emotions and,</a><a name="ts_32859330_32867590_" > with that, increase our control over them.

Even though the trauma is a thing of the past, the emotional brain</a><a name="ts_32887720_32895200_" > keeps generating sensations that make the sufferer feel scared and helpless. It&#x27;s not surprising that so many</a><a name="ts_32895200_32903110_" > trauma survivors are compulsive eaters and drinkers fear making love and avoid many social activities.</a><a name="ts_32903110_32904160_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_32904160_32912390_" > Their sensory world is largely off limits. In order to change, you need to open yourself to your inner</a><a name="ts_32912390_32920240_" > experience. The first step is to allow your mind to focus on your sensations. And notice how, in contrast to</a><a name="ts_32920240_32927290_" > the timeless, ever-present experience of trauma, physical sensations are transient and respond to slight</a><a name="ts_32927290_32935930_" > shifts in body position, changes in breathing, and shifts in thinking. Once you pay attention to your</a><a name="ts_32935930_32943170_" > physical sensations, the next step is to label them as in, when I feel anxious, I feel a crushing</a><a name="ts_32943170_32951390_" > sensation in my chest. I may then say to a patient, focus on that sensation and see how it changes when</a><a name="ts_32951390_32958050_" > you take a deep breath out or when you tap your chest just below your collarbone or when you allow yourself</a><a name="ts_32958050_32966340_" > to cry. Practicing mindfulness calms down the sympathetic nervous system so that you are less likely to be</a><a name="ts_32966340_32973590_" > thrown into fight or flight. Learning to observe and tolerate your physical reactions is a</a><a name="ts_32973590_32979936_" > prerequisite for safely revisiting the past. If you cannot tolerate what you are feeling right now,</a><a name="ts_32980640_32988930_" > opening up the past will only compound the misery and re-traumatize you further. We can tolerate a</a><a name="ts_32988930_32994010_" > great deal of discomfort as long as we stay conscious of the fact that the body&#x27;s commotions constantly</a><a name="ts_32994010_32999550_" > shift. One moment your chest tightens, but after you take a deep breath and exhale,</a><a name="ts_32999770_33004480_" > that feeling softens and you may observe something else, perhaps a tension in your shoulder.</a><a name="ts_33004480_33005696_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_33005696_33009690_" > Now you can start exploring what happens when you take a deeper breath and notice</a><a name="ts_33009690_33016070_" > how your ribcage expands. Once you feel calmer and more curious, you can go back to that sensation</a><a name="ts_33016070_33022280_" > in your shoulder. You should not be surprised if a memory spontaneously arises in which that shoulder</a><a name="ts_33022280_33028390_" > was somehow involved. A further step is to observe the interplay between your thoughts</a><a name="ts_33028390_33036192_" > and your physical sensations. How are particular thoughts registered in your body? Do thoughts like,</a><a name="ts_33036992_33046090_" > my father loves me, or my girlfriend dumped me, produce different sensations? Becoming aware of how your body</a><a name="ts_33046090_33052670_" > organizes particular emotions or memories opens up the possibility of releasing sensations and impulses</a><a name="ts_33052670_33060160_" > you once blocked in order to survive. In chapter 20, on the benefits of theater, I&#x27;ll describe in more</a><a name="ts_33060160_33069690_" > detail how this works. John Kabat-Zinn, one of the pioneers in mind-body medicine, founded the Mindfulness</a><a name="ts_33069690_33079200_" > Based Stress Reduction, or MBSR program, at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979. And his method</a><a name="ts_33079200_33084800_" > has been thoroughly studied for more than three decades. As he describes mindfulness,</a><a name="ts_33084800_33086784_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_33086784_33093070_" > one way to think of this process of transformation is to think of mindfulness as a lens, taking the</a><a name="ts_33093070_33098490_" > scattered and reactive energies of your mind and focusing them into a coherent source of energy for</a><a name="ts_33098490_33107790_" > living, for problem solving, for healing. Mindfulness has been shown to have a positive effect on numerous</a><a name="ts_33107790_33114080_" > psychiatric, psychosomatic, and stress-related symptoms, including depression and chronic pain.</a><a name="ts_33114080_33115456_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_33115456_33120910_" > It has broad effects on physical health, including improvements in immune response, blood pressure,</a><a name="ts_33121110_33127260_" > and cortisol levels.

Research by my Harvard</a><a name="ts_33134590_33141530_" > colleagues, Britta Hotzel and Sarah Lazar, has shown that practicing mindfulness even decreases the</a><a name="ts_33141530_33148768_" > activity of the brain&#x27;s smoke detector, the amygdala, and thus decreases reactivity to potential triggers.</a><a name="ts_33148768_33151904_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_33151904_33154400_" > 3.

Managing your terror all by yourself gives rise to another set of problems.</a><a name="ts_33374112_33380810_" > Dissociation, despair, addictions, a chronic sense of panic, and relationships that are marked by</a><a name="ts_33380810_33388540_" > alienation, disconnection, and explosions. Patients with these histories rarely make the connection</a><a name="ts_33388540_33394816_" > between what happened to them long ago and how they currently feel and behave. Everything just seems</a><a name="ts_33395424_33402870_" > unmanageable. Relief does not come until they are able to acknowledge what has happened and recognize</a><a name="ts_33402870_33409630_" > the invisible demons they&#x27;re struggling with. Recall, for example, the men I described in chapter 11 who had been</a><a name="ts_33409630_33417550_" > abused by pedophile priests. They visited the gym regularly, took anabolic steroids, and were strong</a><a name="ts_33417550_33427250_" > as oxen. However, in our interviews they often acted like scared kids. The hurt boys deep inside still</a><a name="ts_33427830_33437056_" > felt helpless. While human contact and attunement are the wellspring of physiological self-regulation,</a><a name="ts_33437984_33445090_" > the promise of closeness often evokes fear of getting hurt, betrayed, and abandoned. Shame plays an</a><a name="ts_33445090_33449720_" > important role in this. You will find out how rotten and disgusting I am,</a><a name="ts_33449720_33457190_" > and dump me as soon as you really get to know me, a patient might say. Unresolved trauma can take a</a><a name="ts_33457190_33462460_" > terrible toll on relationships. If your heart is still broken because you were assaulted by someone</a><a name="ts_33462460_33468010_" > you loved, you are likely to be preoccupied with not getting hurt again and fear opening up to someone</a><a name="ts_33468010_33475240_" > new. In fact, you may unwittingly try to hurt them before they have a chance to hurt you. This poses a</a><a name="ts_33475240_33481960_" > real challenge for recovery. Once you recognize that post-traumatic reactions started off as efforts to save</a><a name="ts_33481960_33488590_" > your life, you may gather the courage to face your inner music or cacophony, but you will need</a><a name="ts_33488590_33495160_" > help to do so. You have to find someone you can trust enough to accompany you. Someone who can safely</a><a name="ts_33495160_33502016_" > hold your feelings and help you listen to the painful messages from your emotional brain. You need a guide</a><a name="ts_33502688_33508680_" > who is not afraid of your terror and who can contain your darkest rage. Someone who can safeguard the</a><a name="ts_33508680_33513860_" > wholeness of you while you explore the fragmented experiences that you had to keep secret from</a><a name="ts_33513860_33520320_" > yourself for so long. Most traumatized individuals need an anchor and a great deal of coaching to do</a><a name="ts_33520928_33533060_" > this work. Choosing a professional therapist. The training of competent trauma therapists involves</a><a name="ts_33533060_33539080_" > learning about the impact of trauma, abuse, and neglect, and mastering a variety of techniques that can</a><a name="ts_33539080_33547488_" > help to, one, stabilize and calm patients down, two, help to lay traumatic memories and reenactments to rest,</a><a name="ts_33548320_33554730_" > and three, reconnect patients with their fellow men and women. Ideally, the therapist will also have</a><a name="ts_33554730_33561440_" > been on the receiving end of whatever therapy he or she practices. While it&#x27;s inappropriate and</a><a name="ts_33561440_33567540_" > unethical for therapists to tell you the details of their personal struggles, it is perfectly reasonable</a><a name="ts_33567540_33573100_" > to ask what particular forms of therapy they have been trained in, where they learned their skills,</a><a name="ts_33573100_33574112_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_33574112_33582110_" > and whether they&#x27;ve personally benefited from the therapy they propose for you. There is no one</a><a name="ts_33582110_33587590_" > treatment of choice for trauma, and any therapist who believes that his or her particular method is the</a><a name="ts_33587590_33593560_" > only answer to your problems, is suspect of being an ideologue rather than somebody who is</a><a name="ts_33593560_33600960_" > interested in making sure that you get well. No therapist can possibly be familiar with every</a><a name="ts_33600960_33607830_" > effective treatment, and he or she must be open to your exploring options other than the ones he or she</a><a name="ts_33607830_33616380_" > offers. He or she also must be open to learning from you. Gender, race, and personal background are</a><a name="ts_33616380_33625700_" > relevant only if they interfere with helping the patient feel safe and understood. Do you feel basically</a><a name="ts_33625700_33632230_" > comfortable with this therapist? Does he or she seem to feel comfortable in his or her own skin and with</a><a name="ts_33632230_33639300_" > you as a fellow human being? Feeling safe is a necessary condition for you to confront your fears and</a><a name="ts_33639300_33649970_" > anxieties. Someone who is stern, judgmental, agitated, or harsh is likely to leave you feeling scared, abandoned,</a><a name="ts_33650170_33657530_" > and humiliated, and that won&#x27;t help you resolve your traumatic stress. There may be times as old feelings</a><a name="ts_33657530_33662540_" > from the past are stirred up when you become suspicious that the therapist resembles someone</a><a name="ts_33662540_33669530_" > who once hurt or abused you. Hopefully, this is something you can work through together, because in</a><a name="ts_33669530_33675410_" > my experience, patients get better only if they develop deep, positive feelings for their therapists.</a><a name="ts_33675410_33676992_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_33676992_33681330_" > I also don&#x27;t think that you can grow and change unless you feel that you have some impact on the</a><a name="ts_33681330_33691070_" > person who is treating you. The critical question is this. Do you feel that your therapist is</a><a name="ts_33691070_33701790_" > curious to find out who you are and what you, not some generic PTSD patient, need? Are you just a</a><a name="ts_33701790_33707744_" > list of symptoms on some diagnostic questionnaire? Or does your therapist take the time to find out</a><a name="ts_33708320_33714950_" > why you do what you do and think what you think? Therapy is a collaborative process,</a><a name="ts_33714950_33725710_" > a mutual exploration of your self. Patients who have been brutalized by their caregivers as children</a><a name="ts_33725710_33731300_" > often don&#x27;t feel safe with anyone. I often ask my patients if they can think of any person they felt</a><a name="ts_33731300_33737024_" > safe with while they were growing up. Many of them hold tight to the memory of that one teacher,</a><a name="ts_33737600_33744810_" > neighbor, shopkeeper, coach, or minister who showed that he or she cared, and that memory is often the</a><a name="ts_33744810_33755800_" > seed of learning to re-engage. We are a hopeful species. Working with trauma is as much about remembering</a><a name="ts_33755800_33764550_" > how we survived as it is about what is broken. I also ask my patients to imagine what they were like</a><a name="ts_33764550_33772070_" > as newborns, whether they were lovable and filled with spunk. All of them believe they were and have</a><a name="ts_33772070_33777810_" > some image of what they must have been like before they were hurt. Some people don&#x27;t remember anybody</a><a name="ts_33777810_33784190_" > they felt safe with. For them, engaging with horses or dogs may be much safer than dealing with human</a><a name="ts_33784190_33789990_" > beings. This principle is currently being applied in many therapeutic settings to great effect,</a><a name="ts_33790170_33797340_" > including in jails, residential treatment programs, and veterans rehabilitation. Jennifer,</a><a name="ts_33797340_33803750_" > a member of the first graduating class of the Vander Kolk Center, who had come to the program as an</a><a name="ts_33803750_33811000_" > out-of-control, mute 14-year-old, said during her graduation ceremony that having been entrusted with</a><a name="ts_33811000_33817740_" > the responsibility of caring for a horse was the critical first step for her. Her growing bond with</a><a name="ts_33817740_33822800_" > her horse helped her feel safe enough to begin to relate to the staff of the center and then to focus on</a><a name="ts_33822800_33833280_" > her classes, take her SATs, and be accepted to college. 4. Communal Rhythms and Synchrony</a><a name="ts_33833280_33835904_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_33835904_33841180_" > From the moment of our birth, our relationships are embodied in responsive faces, gestures, and</a><a name="ts_33841180_33848640_" > touch. As we saw in Chapter 7, these are the foundations of attachment. Trauma results in a</a><a name="ts_33848640_33855290_" > breakdown of attuned physical synchrony. When you enter the waiting room of a PTSD clinic, you can</a><a name="ts_33855290_33861820_" > immediately tell the patients from the staff by their frozen faces and collapsed, but simultaneously</a><a name="ts_33862816_33870620_" > agitated bodies. Unfortunately, many therapists ignore these physical communications and focus only on</a><a name="ts_33870620_33876870_" > the words with which their patients communicate. The healing power of community, as expressed in</a><a name="ts_33876870_33882980_" > music and rhythms, was brought home for me in the spring of 1997, when I was following the work</a><a name="ts_33882980_33890610_" > of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa. In some places we visited, terrible violence</a><a name="ts_33890610_33897150_" > continued. One day, I attended a group for rape survivors in the courtyard of a clinic in a township</a><a name="ts_33897150_33904790_" > outside Johannesburg. We could hear the sound of bullets being fired at a distance while smoke billowed</a><a name="ts_33904790_33911960_" > over the walls of the compound, and the smell of tear gas hung in the air. Later, we heard that 40</a><a name="ts_33911960_33920300_" > people had been killed. Yet, while the surroundings were foreign and terrifying, I recognized this group</a><a name="ts_33920300_33928080_" > all too well. The women sat slumped over, sad and frozen, like so many rape therapy groups I had seen</a><a name="ts_33928080_33934270_" > in Boston. I felt a familiar sense of helplessness, and, surrounded by collapsed people,</a><a name="ts_33934270_33941050_" > I felt myself mentally collapse as well. Then one of the women started to hum, while gently swaying</a><a name="ts_33941050_33951310_" > back and forth. Slowly, a rhythm emerged. Bit by bit, other women joined in. Soon, the whole group</a><a name="ts_33951310_33959050_" > was singing, moving, and getting up to dance. It was an astounding transformation. People coming back to</a><a name="ts_33959050_33967584_" > life, faces becoming attuned, vitality returning to bodies. I made a vow to apply what I had seen there,</a><a name="ts_33968288_33976890_" > and to study how rhythm, chanting, and movement can help heal trauma. We&#x27;ll see more of this in Chapter 20,</a><a name="ts_33976890_33982630_" > on theater, where I show how groups of young people, among them juvenile offenders and</a><a name="ts_33982630_33987904_" > at-risk foster kids, gradually learn to work together and to depend on one another, whether</a><a name="ts_33988448_33994432_" > as partners in Shakespearean swordplay, or as the writers and performers of full-length musicals.</a><a name="ts_33994432_33995680_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_33995680_34001730_" > Different patients have told me how much choral singing, aikido, tango dancing, and kickboxing have</a><a name="ts_34001730_34006080_" > helped them, and I am delighted to pass the recommendations on to other people I treat.</a><a name="ts_34006080_34008384_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_34008384_34013170_" > I learned another powerful lesson about rhythm and healing when clinicians at the trauma center</a><a name="ts_34013170_34020070_" > were asked to treat a five-year-old mute girl named Ying Mi, who had been adopted from an orphanage</a><a name="ts_34020070_34026790_" > in China. After months of failed attempts to make contact with her, my colleagues Deborah Rozelle</a><a name="ts_34026790_34033510_" > and Liz Warner realized that her rhythmical engagement system didn&#x27;t work. She could not resonate with the</a><a name="ts_34033510_34044080_" > voices and faces of the people around her. That led them to sensory motor therapy. The Sensory Integration Clinic</a><a name="ts_34044080_34050690_" > in Watertown, Massachusetts is a wondrous indoor playground filled with swings, tubs full of</a><a name="ts_34050690_34057000_" > multicolored rubber balls so deep that you can make yourself disappear, balance beams, crawl spaces</a><a name="ts_34057000_34063200_" > fashioned from plastic tubing, and ladders that lead to platforms from which you can dive onto foam-filled</a><a name="ts_34063200_34073056_" > mats. The staff bathed Ying Mi in the tub with plastic balls, then helped her feel sensations on her skin.</a><a name="ts_34073056_34074560_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_34074560_34080928_" > They helped her sway on swings and crawl under weighted blankets. After six weeks,</a><a name="ts_34081696_34088700_" > something shifted, and she started to talk. Ying Mi&#x27;s dramatic improvement inspired us to start a</a><a name="ts_34088700_34093600_" > sensory integration clinic at the trauma center, which we now also use in our residential treatment</a><a name="ts_34093600_34100730_" > programs. We have not yet explored how well sensory integration works for traumatized adults, but I</a><a name="ts_34100730_34108700_" > regularly incorporate sensory integration experiences and dance in my seminars. Learning to become attuned</a><a name="ts_34108700_34117440_" > provides parents and their kids with a visceral experience of reciprocity. Parent-child interaction</a><a name="ts_34117440_34127310_" > therapy, known as PCIT, is an interactive therapy that fosters this, as is SMART, which is an acronym for</a><a name="ts_34127310_34135450_" > Sensory Motor Arousal Regulation Treatment, developed by my colleagues at the trauma center. When we play</a><a name="ts_34135450_34142540_" > together, we feel physically attuned and experience a sense of connection and joy. Improvisation exercises</a><a name="ts_34142540_34149680_" > also are a marvelous way to help people connect, enjoy, and exploring. The moment you see a group</a><a name="ts_34149680_34155840_" > of grim-faced people break out in a giggle, you know that the spell of misery is broken.</a><a name="ts_34155840_34160128_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_34160128_34167660_" > Number five, getting in touch. Mainstream trauma treatment has paid scant attention to helping</a><a name="ts_34167660_34174580_" > terrified people to safely experience their sensations and emotions. Medications such as serotonin reuptake</a><a name="ts_34174580_34181050_" > blockers, risperidol, and Seroquel, increasingly have taken the place of helping people to deal with their</a><a name="ts_34181050_34187550_" > sensory world. However, the most natural way that we humans calm down our distress is by being touched,</a><a name="ts_34187910_34196600_" > hugged, and rocked. This helps with excess arousal and makes us feel intact, safe, protected, and in</a><a name="ts_34196600_34206080_" > charge. Touch, the most elementary tool that we have to calm down, is prescribed from most therapeutic</a><a name="ts_34206080_34212730_" > practices. Yet you can&#x27;t fully recover if you don&#x27;t feel safe in your skin. Therefore, I encourage all my</a><a name="ts_34212730_34220670_" > patients to engage in some sort of bodywork, be it therapeutic massage, Feldenkrais, or craniosacral</a><a name="ts_34220670_34229070_" > therapy. I asked my favorite bodywork practitioner, Lisha Sky, about her practice with traumatized</a><a name="ts_34229070_34236440_" > individuals. Here are some of what she told me. I never begin a bodywork session without establishing</a><a name="ts_34236440_34242720_" > a personal connection. I&#x27;m not taking a history. I&#x27;m not finding out how traumatized a person is or</a><a name="ts_34242720_34249700_" > what happened to them. I check in where they are in their body right now. I ask them if there is</a><a name="ts_34249700_34255710_" > anything they want me to pay attention to. All the while, I&#x27;m assessing their posture, whether they</a><a name="ts_34255710_34262950_" > look me in the eye, how tense or relaxed they seem, are they connecting with me or not. The first</a><a name="ts_34262950_34269510_" > decision I make is if they will feel safer face up or face down. If I don&#x27;t know them, I usually start</a><a name="ts_34269510_34276030_" > face up. I&#x27;m very careful about draping, very careful to let them feel safe with whatever clothing</a><a name="ts_34276030_34282930_" > they want to leave on. These are important boundaries to set up right at the beginning. Then, with my first</a><a name="ts_34282930_34293150_" > touch, I make firm, safe contact. Nothing forced or sharp. Nothing too fast. The touch is slow, easy</a><a name="ts_34293150_34300700_" > for the client to follow, gently rhythmic. It can be as strong as a handshake. The first place I might</a><a name="ts_34300700_34306460_" > touch is their hand and forearm because that&#x27;s the safest place to touch anybody, the place where they</a><a name="ts_34306460_34312940_" > can touch you back. You have to meet their point of resistance, the place that has the most tension,</a><a name="ts_34313888_34319680_" > and meet it with an equal amount of energy. That releases the frozen tension. You can&#x27;t hesitate.</a><a name="ts_34320288_34325024_" > hesitate. Hesitation communicates a lack of trust in yourself. Slow movement,</a><a name="ts_34325728_34331550_" > careful attuning to the client, is different from hesitation. You have to meet them with tremendous</a><a name="ts_34331550_34336510_" > confidence and empathy. Let the pressure of your touch meet the tension they are holding in their</a><a name="ts_34336510_34346430_" > bodies. What does body work do for people? Lish&#x27;s reply, just like you can thirst for water,</a><a name="ts_34346610_34354208_" > you can thirst for touch. It is a comfort to be met confidently, deeply, firmly, gently, responsively.</a><a name="ts_34354208_34355424_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_34355424_34360630_" > Mindful touch and movement grounds people and allows them to discover tensions that they may</a><a name="ts_34360630_34365340_" > have held for so long that they are no longer even aware of them. When you are touched,</a><a name="ts_34365560_34370690_" > you wake up to the part of your body that is being touched. The body is physically restricted</a><a name="ts_34370690_34376900_" > when emotions are bound up inside. People&#x27;s shoulders tighten, their facial muscles tense.</a><a name="ts_34377824_34382810_" > They spend enormous energy on holding back their tears or any sound or movement that might betray their</a><a name="ts_34382810_34390570_" > inner state. When the physical tension is released, the feelings can be released. Movement helps breathing to</a><a name="ts_34390570_34396750_" > become deeper. And as the tensions are released, expressive sounds can be discharged. The body</a><a name="ts_34396750_34404700_" > becomes freer, breathing freer, being in flow. Touch makes it possible to live in a body that can move</a><a name="ts_34404700_34411400_" > in response to being moved. People who are terrified need to get a sense of where their bodies are in space</a><a name="ts_34411400_34417376_" > and of their boundaries. Firm and reassuring touch lets them know where those boundaries are,</a><a name="ts_34418272_34424880_" > what&#x27;s outside them, where their bodies end. They discover that they don&#x27;t constantly have to wonder who</a><a name="ts_34424880_34430340_" > and where they are. They discover that their body is solid and that they don&#x27;t have to be constantly</a><a name="ts_34430340_34442430_" > on guard. Touch lets them know that they are safe. Number six, taking action. The body responds to</a><a name="ts_34442430_34448700_" > extreme experiences by secreting stress hormones. These are often blamed for subsequent illness and</a><a name="ts_34448700_34454530_" > disease. However, stress hormones are meant to give us the strength and endurance to respond to</a><a name="ts_34454530_34461570_" > extraordinary conditions. People who actively do something to deal with a disaster, such as rescuing loved</a><a name="ts_34461570_34468230_" > ones or strangers, transporting people to a hospital, being part of a medical team, pitching tents or</a><a name="ts_34468230_34474240_" > cooking meals, utilize their stress hormones for their proper purpose and therefore are at much lower</a><a name="ts_34474240_34481560_" > risk of becoming traumatized. Nevertheless, everyone has his or her breaking point, and even the best</a><a name="ts_34481560_34488850_" > prepared person may become overwhelmed by the magnitude of the challenge. Helplessness and immobilization</a><a name="ts_34488850_34495230_" > keep people from utilizing their stress hormones to defend themselves. When that happens, their hormones</a><a name="ts_34495230_34501190_" > still are being pumped out, but the actions they&#x27;re supposed to fuel are thwarted.

Research has shown that up to 100 minutes of</a><a name="ts_35208560_35215800_" > flooding, in which anxiety-provoking triggers are presented in an intense, sustained form, are required</a><a name="ts_35215800_35223040_" > before decreases in anxiety are reported.

They frequently report a heightened sense of compassionate energy, accompanied by</a><a name="ts_35656070_35664710_" > curiosity, clarity, confidence, creativity, and connectedness. Meterhoff and his colleagues were looking for</a><a name="ts_35664710_35671400_" > a medication that would enhance the effectiveness of psychotherapy, and they became interested in MDMA because</a><a name="ts_35671400_35678400_" > it decreases fear, defensiveness, and numbing, as well as helping to access inner experience. They</a><a name="ts_35678400_35679872_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_35679872_35685750_" > thought MDMA might enable patients to stay within the window of tolerance so they could revisit their</a><a name="ts_35685750_35693550_" > traumatic memories without suffering overwhelming physiological and emotional arousal. The initial pilot</a><a name="ts_35693550_35700380_" > studies have supported that expectation. The first study involving combat veterans, firefighters, and police</a><a name="ts_35700380_35709090_" > officers with PTSD had positive results. In the next study of a group of 20 victims of assault who had</a><a name="ts_35709090_35716370_" > been unresponsive to previous forms of therapy, 12 subjects received MDMA and eight received an inactive</a><a name="ts_35716370_35725620_" > placebo. Sitting or lying in a comfortable room, they then all received two eight-hour psychotherapy sessions,</a><a name="ts_35726160_35733760_" > mainly using internal family systems therapy, known as IFS, the subject of chapter 17 of this book.</a><a name="ts_35733760_35735936_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_35735936_35742530_" > Two months later, 83% of the patients who received MDMA plus psychotherapy were considered completely</a><a name="ts_35742530_35751400_" > cured, compared with 25% of the placebo group. None of the patients had adverse effects. Perhaps most</a><a name="ts_35751400_35757056_" > interesting, when the participants were interviewed more than a year after the study was completed,</a><a name="ts_35757056_35758112_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_35758112_35765400_" > they had maintained their gains. By being able to observe the trauma from the calm, mindful state</a><a name="ts_35765400_35774520_" > that IFS calls self, a term I&#x27;ll discuss further in chapter 17, mind and brain are in a position to</a><a name="ts_35774520_35780430_" > integrate the trauma into the overall fabric of life. This is very different from traditional</a><a name="ts_35781170_35787890_" > desensitization techniques, which are about blunting a person&#x27;s response to past horrors. This is about</a><a name="ts_35787890_35794170_" > association and integration, making an horrendous event that overwhelmed you in the past</a><a name="ts_35794170_35800880_" > into a memory of something that happened a long time ago. Nonetheless, psychedelic</a><a name="ts_35800880_35806730_" > substances are powerful agents with a troubled history. They can easily be misused through careless</a><a name="ts_35806730_35813510_" > administration and poor maintenance of therapeutic boundaries. It is to be hoped that MDMA will not</a><a name="ts_35813510_35825150_" > be another magic cure released from Pandora&#x27;s box. What about medications? People have always used</a><a name="ts_35825150_35833180_" > drugs to deal with traumatic stress. Each culture and each generation has its preferences. Gin, vodka,</a><a name="ts_35833180_35843630_" > beer or whiskey, hashish, marijuana, cannabis or ganja, cocaine, opioids like OxyContin, tranquilizers</a><a name="ts_35843630_35851280_" > such as Valium, Xanax or Klonopin. When people are desperate, they will do just about anything to feel</a><a name="ts_35851280_35859490_" > calmer and more in control. Mainstream psychiatry follows this tradition. Over the past decade,</a><a name="ts_35859490_35868128_" > the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs combined have spent over $4.5 billion on antidepressants,</a><a name="ts_35868768_35876690_" > antipsychotics, and anti-anxiety drugs. A June 2010 internal report from the Defense Department&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_35876690_35888020_" > Pharmicoeconomic Center at Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio showed that 213,972, or 20 percent,</a><a name="ts_35888020_35895970_" > of the 1.1 million active duty troops surveyed were taking some form of psychotropic drug, such as</a><a name="ts_35895970_35906540_" > antidepressants, antipsychotics, sedative hypnotics, or other controlled substances. However, drugs cannot</a><a name="ts_35906540_35913940_" > cure trauma. They can only dampen the expressions of a disturbed physiology, and they do not teach the</a><a name="ts_35913940_35921152_" > lasting lessons of self-regulation. They can help to control feelings and behavior, but always at a price,</a><a name="ts_35921152_35922240_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_35922240_35928050_" > because they work by blocking the chemical systems that regulate engagement, motivation, pain,</a><a name="ts_35928210_35935120_" > and pleasure. Some of my colleagues remain optimistic. I keep attending meetings where</a><a name="ts_35935120_35942240_" > serious scientists discuss their quest for the elusive magic bullet that will miraculously reset the fear</a><a name="ts_35942240_35950800_" > circuits of the brain as if traumatic stress involved only one simple brain circuit. I also regularly</a><a name="ts_35950800_35959510_" > prescribe medications. Just about every group of psychotropic agents has been used to treat some</a><a name="ts_35959510_35968990_" > aspect of PTSD. The serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the SSRIs, such as Prozac, Zoloft, Defexor,</a><a name="ts_35969050_35975930_" > and Paxil, have been most thoroughly studied, and they can make feelings less intense and life more</a><a name="ts_35975930_35984740_" > manageable. Patients on SSRIs often feel calmer and more in control. Feeling less overwhelmed often makes</a><a name="ts_35984740_35992960_" > it easier to engage in therapy. Other patients feel blunted by SSRIs. They feel they&#x27;re losing their edge.</a><a name="ts_35992960_35994464_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_35994464_36000170_" > I approach it as an empirical question. Let&#x27;s see what works. And only the patient can be the judge</a><a name="ts_36000170_36007910_" > of that. On the other hand, if one SSRI does not work, it&#x27;s worth trying another, because they all have</a><a name="ts_36007910_36014400_" > slightly different effects. It&#x27;s interesting that the SSRIs are widely used to treat depression,</a><a name="ts_36014560_36020864_" > but in a study in which we compared Prozac with eye movement desensitization and reprocessing,</a><a name="ts_36021472_36029610_" > EMDR, for patients with PTSD, many of whom were also depressed, EMDR proved to be a more effective</a><a name="ts_36029610_36037470_" > antidepressant than Prozac. I&#x27;ll return to that subject in Chapter 15. Medicines that target the</a><a name="ts_36037470_36043520_" > autonomic nervous system, like propranolol or clonidine, can help to decrease hyperarousal and</a><a name="ts_36043520_36049320_" > reactivity distress. This family of drugs works by blocking the physical effects of adrenaline,</a><a name="ts_36049820_36056610_" > the fuel of arousal, and thus reduces nightmares, insomnia, and reactivity to trauma triggers.</a><a name="ts_36056610_36058336_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_36058336_36064760_" > Blocking adrenaline can help to keep the rational brain online and make choices possible.

One that</a><a name="ts_37881170_37887580_" > keeps track of the self across time, and one that registers the self in the present moment. The first,</a><a name="ts_37887580_37894640_" > our autobiographical self, creates connections among experiences and assembles them into a coherent</a><a name="ts_37894640_37901770_" > story. This system is rooted in language. Our narratives change with the telling, as our perspective</a><a name="ts_37901770_37909760_" > changes, and as we incorporate new input. The other system, moment-to-moment self-awareness, is based</a><a name="ts_37909760_37916620_" > primarily in physical sensations. But if we feel safe and are not rushed, we can find words to communicate</a><a name="ts_37916620_37922790_" > that experience as well. These two ways of knowing are localized in different parts of</a><a name="ts_37922790_37928130_" > the brain that are largely disconnected from each other. Only the system devoted to self-awareness,</a><a name="ts_37928210_37935230_" > which is based in the medial prefrontal cortex, can change the emotional brain. In the groups I used</a><a name="ts_37935230_37941650_" > to lead for veterans, I could sometimes see these two systems working side by side. The soldiers told</a><a name="ts_37941650_37948510_" > horrible tales of death and destruction, but I noticed that their bodies often simultaneously radiated a sense of</a><a name="ts_37948510_37954580_" > pride and belonging. Similarly, many patients tell me about the happy families they grew up in</a><a name="ts_37954580_37961370_" > while their bodies are slumped over, and their voices sound anxious and uptight. One system creates</a><a name="ts_37961370_37966870_" > a story for public consumption, and if we tell that story often enough, we are likely to start believing</a><a name="ts_37966870_37973850_" > that it contains the whole truth. But the other system registers a different truth, how we experience the</a><a name="ts_37973850_37982240_" > situation deep inside.

Instead of crying for her loneliness or being angry</a><a name="ts_38085450_38091890_" > about the lack of support, she said fiercely, she was stupid, whiny, and dependent. She should</a><a name="ts_38091890_38097430_" > have stepped up to the plate and sucked it up.

She started to sob and kept quiet for a long</a><a name="ts_38118750_38126770_" > time until finally she said, no, she didn&#x27;t deserve that. She should have been supported. Somebody</a><a name="ts_38126770_38132520_" > should have looked after her.

Most of us are better at describing someone else than we are describing ourselves. As I once</a><a name="ts_38224520_38231712_" > heard Harvard psychologist Jerome Kagan say, the task of describing most private experiences can be</a><a name="ts_38232384_38240170_" > likened to reaching down to a deep well to pick up small, fragile crystal figures while you are</a><a name="ts_38240170_38248690_" > wearing thick leather mittens.

As far as I&#x27;m aware, the first systematic test of</a><a name="ts_38469710_38476400_" > the power of language to relieve trauma was done in 1986 when James Pennebaker at the University of</a><a name="ts_38476400_38483860_" > Texas in Austin turned his introductory psychology class into an experimental laboratory. Pennebaker</a><a name="ts_38483860_38488850_" > started off with a healthy respect for the importance of inhibition, of keeping things to yourself,</a><a name="ts_38489150_38495590_" > which he viewed as the glue of civilization. But he also assumed that people pay a price for trying to</a><a name="ts_38495590_38503000_" > suppress being aware of the elephant in the room. He began by asking each student to identify a deeply</a><a name="ts_38503000_38509240_" > personal experience that they found very stressful or traumatic. He then divided the class into three</a><a name="ts_38509240_38515540_" > groups. One would write about what was currently going on in their lives. The second would write</a><a name="ts_38515540_38520610_" > about the details of the traumatic or stressful event. And the third would recount the facts of the</a><a name="ts_38520610_38526210_" > experience, their feelings and emotions about it, and what impact they thought this event had had on</a><a name="ts_38526210_38534560_" > their lives. All of the students wrote continuously for 15 minutes on four consecutive days while sitting</a><a name="ts_38534560_38541568_" > alone in a small cubicle in the psychology building. The students took the study very seriously. Many</a><a name="ts_38542304_38549160_" > revealed secrets that they had never told anyone. They often cried as they wrote, and many confided in</a><a name="ts_38549160_38556470_" > the course assistance that they&#x27;d become preoccupied with these experiences. Of the 200 participants, 65 wrote</a><a name="ts_38556470_38562380_" > about a childhood trauma. Although the death of a family member was the most frequent topic, 22% of the</a><a name="ts_38562380_38571770_" > women and 10% of the men reported sexual trauma prior to the age of 17. The researchers asked the students</a><a name="ts_38571770_38577190_" > about their health and were surprised how often the students spontaneously reported histories of major</a><a name="ts_38577190_38585920_" > and minor health problems, cancer, high blood pressure, ulcers, flu, headaches, and earaches. And those</a><a name="ts_38585920_38593340_" > who reported a traumatic sexual experience in childhood had been hospitalized an average of 1.7 days in the</a><a name="ts_38593340_38599800_" > previous year, almost twice the rate of the others. The team then compared the number of visits to the</a><a name="ts_38599800_38604440_" > student health center participants had made during the month prior to the study to the number in the month</a><a name="ts_38604440_38610570_" > following it. The group that had written about both the facts and the emotions related to their</a><a name="ts_38610570_38618310_" > trauma clearly benefited the most. They had a 50% drop in doctor visits compared with the other two</a><a name="ts_38618310_38624680_" > groups. Writing about their deepest thoughts and feelings about traumas had improved their mood and</a><a name="ts_38624680_38631150_" > resulted in a more optimistic attitude and better physical health. When the students themselves were asked to</a><a name="ts_38631150_38637760_" > assess the study, they focused on how it had increased their self-understanding. Some wrote,</a><a name="ts_38637760_38638816_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_38638816_38643904_" > It helped me think about what I felt during those times.

In a subsequent study,</a><a name="ts_38662210_38667510_" > Pennebaker asked half of a group of 72 students to talk into a tape recorder about the most traumatic</a><a name="ts_38667510_38674580_" > experience of their lives. The other half discussed their plans for the rest of the day. As they spoke,</a><a name="ts_38674580_38680830_" > researchers monitored their physiological reactions – blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension,</a><a name="ts_38680990_38687610_" > and hand temperature. This study had similar results. Those who allowed themselves to feel</a><a name="ts_38687610_38695000_" > their emotions showed significant physiological changes, both immediate and long-term. During their</a><a name="ts_38695000_38700400_" > confessions, blood pressure, heart rate, and other autonomic functions increased. But afterward,</a><a name="ts_38700560_38706430_" > their arousal fell to levels below where they had been at the start of the study. The drop in blood pressure</a><a name="ts_38706430_38713504_" > could still be measured six weeks after the experiment ended. It&#x27;s now widely accepted that</a><a name="ts_38714112_38721360_" > stressful experiences, whether divorce or final exams or loneliness, have a negative effect on immune</a><a name="ts_38721360_38728620_" > function. But this was a highly controversial notion at the time of Pennebaker&#x27;s study. Building on his</a><a name="ts_38728620_38734460_" > protocols, a team of researchers at the Ohio State University College of Medicine compared two groups of</a><a name="ts_38734460_38743170_" > students who wrote either about a personal trauma or a superficial topic. Again, those who wrote about</a><a name="ts_38743170_38748810_" > personal traumas had fewer visits to the student health center, and their improved health correlated with</a><a name="ts_38748810_38755660_" > improved immune function, as measured by the action of T-lymphocytes, which are natural killer cells,</a><a name="ts_38755820_38761960_" > and other immune markers in the blood. This effect was most obvious directly after the experiment,</a><a name="ts_38762000_38767450_" > but it could still be detected six weeks later. Writing experiments from around the world,</a><a name="ts_38767450_38774260_" > with grade school students, nursing home residents, medical students, maximum security prisoners,</a><a name="ts_38774960_38781250_" > arthritis sufferers, new mothers, and rape victims consistently show that writing about upsetting</a><a name="ts_38781250_38790400_" > events improves physical and mental health.

Some patients even appear to change their personal identity from</a><a name="ts_38874200_38882510_" > timid to forceful and aggressive, or from anxiously compliant to starkly seductive.

The capacity of art, music, and dance to</a><a name="ts_38972580_38978320_" > circumvent the speechlessness that comes with terror may be one reason they are used as trauma treatments</a><a name="ts_38978320_38984920_" > in cultures around the world. One of the few systematic studies to compare non-verbal artistic</a><a name="ts_38984920_38992210_" > expression with writing was done by James Pennebaker and Anne Krantz, a San Francisco dance and movement</a><a name="ts_38992210_38999000_" > therapist. One third of a group of 64 students was asked to disclose a personal traumatic experience</a><a name="ts_38999000_39005020_" > through expressive body movements for at least 10 minutes a day for three consecutive days and then to</a><a name="ts_39005020_39011168_" > write about it for another 10 minutes. A second group danced but did not write about their trauma,</a><a name="ts_39012000_39017800_" > and a third group engaged in a routine exercise program. Over the three following months,</a><a name="ts_39017960_39024450_" > members of all groups reported that they felt happier and healthier. However, only the expressive</a><a name="ts_39024450_39031300_" > movement group that also wrote showed objective evidence, better physical health, and an improved</a><a name="ts_39031300_39039488_" > grade point average. The study did not evaluate specific PTSD symptoms. Pennebaker and Krantz concluded,</a><a name="ts_39040256_39045920_" > the mere expression of the trauma is not sufficient. Health does appear to require translating experiences</a><a name="ts_39045920_39054240_" > into language. However, we still don&#x27;t know whether this conclusion, that language is essential to</a><a name="ts_39054240_39061770_" > healing, is in fact always true. Writing studies that have focused on PTSD symptoms, as opposed to</a><a name="ts_39061770_39068490_" > general health, have been disappointing. When I discussed this with Pennebaker, he cautioned me that most</a><a name="ts_39068490_39073970_" > writing studies of PTSD patients have been done in group settings where participants were expected to share</a><a name="ts_39073970_39081060_" > their stories. He reiterated the point I&#x27;ve made previously, that the object of writing is to</a><a name="ts_39081060_39091616_" > write to yourself, to let yourself know what you have been trying to avoid.

Finding a responsive community in which to tell</a><a name="ts_39219620_39226040_" > your truth makes recovery possible. That&#x27;s also why survivors need professional therapists who are</a><a name="ts_39226040_39232240_" > trained to listen to the agonizing details of their lives. I recall the first time a veteran told me</a><a name="ts_39232240_39238272_" > about killing a child in Vietnam. I had a vivid flashback to when I was about seven years old,</a><a name="ts_39238944_39242730_" > and my father told me that a child next door had been beaten to death by Nazi soldiers</a><a name="ts_39242730_39249040_" > in front of our house for showing a lack of respect. My reaction to the veterans&#x27; confession</a><a name="ts_39249040_39255910_" > was too much to bear, and I had to end the session. That is why therapists need to have done their own</a><a name="ts_39255910_39261500_" > intensive therapy so they can take care of themselves and remain emotionally available to their patients,</a><a name="ts_39261760_39270000_" > even when their patient stories arouse feelings of rage or revulsion.

Later, if I see her chest tighten and her breath almost</a><a name="ts_39406800_39412890_" > disappear, I can stop her and ask her to focus on her hands and move them so that she can feel</a><a name="ts_39412890_39420460_" > herself as separate from the trauma.

Numerous studies have found that people with PTSD have more general problems</a><a name="ts_39482290_39487790_" > with focused attention and with learning new information. Alexander McFarland did a simple</a><a name="ts_39487790_39494470_" > test. He asked a group of people to name as many words beginning with the letter B as they could</a><a name="ts_39494470_39504480_" > in one minute. Normal subjects averaged 15 words.

Even traumatized patients who are making real</a><a name="ts_39532700_39538230_" > contributions in teaching, business, medicine, or the arts, and who are successfully raising their</a><a name="ts_39538230_39546300_" > children, expend a lot more energy on the everyday tasks of living than do ordinary mortals. Yet another</a><a name="ts_39546300_39550380_" > pitfall of language is the illusion that our thinking can easily be corrected if it doesn&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_39550380_39558190_" > make sense. The cognitive part of cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on changing such</a><a name="ts_39558190_39564590_" > dysfunctional thinking. This is a top-down approach to change in which the therapist challenges or</a><a name="ts_39564590_39571136_" > reframes negative cognitions.

Such information would be</a><a name="ts_39600310_39606290_" > unlikely to help her until she gained access to the frightened, abandoned parts of herself. The parts</a><a name="ts_39606290_39614420_" > expressed by her terror of dependence.

The reason people become overwhelmed by telling their stories,</a><a name="ts_39665620_39672940_" > and the reason they have cognitive flashbacks, is that their brains have changed. As Freud and</a><a name="ts_39672940_39680120_" > Broyer observed, trauma does not simply act as a releasing agent for symptoms. Rather, the psychical</a><a name="ts_39680120_39686010_" > trauma, or more precisely the memory of the trauma, acts like a foreign body which long after its</a><a name="ts_39686010_39692940_" > entry must continue to be regarded as an agent that is still at work, like a splinter that</a><a name="ts_39692940_39698180_" > causes an infection. It is the body&#x27;s response to the foreign object that becomes the problem</a><a name="ts_39698180_39706550_" > more than the object itself. Modern neuroscience solidly supports Freud&#x27;s notion that many of our</a><a name="ts_39706550_39713850_" > conscious thoughts are complex rationalizations for the flood of instincts, reflexes, motives, and deep-seated</a><a name="ts_39713850_39720570_" > memories that emanate from the unconscious. As we have seen, trauma interferes with the proper</a><a name="ts_39720570_39727210_" > functioning of brain areas that manage and interpret experience. A robust sense of self,</a><a name="ts_39727390_39733150_" > one that allows a person to state confidently, this is what I think and feel, and this is what</a><a name="ts_39733150_39740820_" > is going on with me, depends on a healthy and dynamic interplay among these areas. Almost every brain</a><a name="ts_39740820_39747440_" > imaging study of trauma patients finds abnormal activation of the insula. This part of the brain integrates</a><a name="ts_39747440_39753080_" > and interprets the input from the internal organs, including our muscles, joints, and balance,</a><a name="ts_39753080_39761080_" > or proprioceptive system to generate the sense of being embodied. The insula can transmit signals</a><a name="ts_39761080_39766630_" > to the amygdala that trigger fight-or-flight responses. This does not require any cognitive</a><a name="ts_39766630_39772130_" > input or any conscious recognition that something is going awry. You just feel on edge and unable to</a><a name="ts_39772130_39779160_" > focus or, at worst, have a sense of imminent doom. These powerful feelings are generated deep inside the</a><a name="ts_39779160_39786030_" > brain and cannot be eliminated by reason or understanding. Being constantly assaulted by,</a><a name="ts_39786030_39793320_" > but consciously cut off from the origin of bodily sensations, produces alexithymia, not being able</a><a name="ts_39793320_39799500_" > to sense and communicate what is going on with you.

Alexithymia, dissociation, and shutdown all involve the brain structures that enable us to focus,</a><a name="ts_39815010_39821160_" > know what we feel, and take action to protect ourselves. When these essential structures are</a><a name="ts_39821160_39827990_" > subjected to inescapable shock, the result may be confusion and agitation, or it may be emotional</a><a name="ts_39827990_39834220_" > detachment, often accompanied by out-of-body experiences, the feeling you&#x27;re watching yourself</a><a name="ts_39834220_39843712_" > from far away.

Each time he reported a new memory or sensation,</a><a name="ts_40051480_40055660_" > I urged him to notice what was coming to mind, and resumed the finger movements.</a><a name="ts_40055660_40056992_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_40056992_40063260_" > At the end of that visit, he looked calmer and visibly relieved. He told me that the memory of</a><a name="ts_40063260_40068760_" > the stabbing had lost its intensity. It was now something unpleasant that had happened a long time</a><a name="ts_40068760_40075690_" > ago. It really sucked, he said thoughtfully, and it kept me off-kilter for years. But I&#x27;m surprised</a><a name="ts_40075690_40083620_" > what a good life I eventually was able to carve out for myself. Our third session, the following week,</a><a name="ts_40083700_40088440_" > dealt with the aftermath of the trauma, how he had used drugs and alcohol for years to cope</a><a name="ts_40088440_40095090_" > with this rage. As we repeated the EMDR sequences, still more memories arose. David remembered</a><a name="ts_40095090_40100110_" > talking with a prison guard he knew about having his incarcerated assailant killed and then changing</a><a name="ts_40100110_40105680_" > his mind. Recalling this decision was profoundly liberating. He had come to see himself as a</a><a name="ts_40105680_40111180_" > monster who was barely in control, but realizing that he turned away from revenge, put him back in</a><a name="ts_40111180_40117620_" > touch with a mindful, generous side of himself. Next, he spontaneously realized he was treating</a><a name="ts_40117620_40122630_" > his son the way he had felt toward his teenaged attackers. As our session ended,</a><a name="ts_40123070_40127710_" > he asked if I could meet with him and his family so he could tell his son what had happened and ask</a><a name="ts_40127710_40134440_" > for his forgiveness. At our fifth and final session, he reported that he was sleeping better and said</a><a name="ts_40134440_40139470_" > that for the first time in his life he felt a sense of inner peace. A year later, he called to report not</a><a name="ts_40139470_40144330_" > only that he and his wife had grown closer and had started to practice yoga together, but also that</a><a name="ts_40144330_40157190_" > he laughed more and took real pleasure in his gardening and woodworking. Learning about EMDR. My experience</a><a name="ts_40157190_40163970_" > with David is one of many I have had over the past two decades in which EMDR helped to make painful</a><a name="ts_40163970_40171220_" > recreations of the trauma a thing of the past. My introduction to this method came through Maggie,</a><a name="ts_40171480_40179060_" > a spunky young psychologist who ran a halfway house for sexually abused girls. Maggie got into one</a><a name="ts_40179060_40185500_" > confrontation after another, clashing with nearly everybody except the 13 and 14 year old girls</a><a name="ts_40185500_40193220_" > she cared for. She did drugs, had dangerous and often violent boyfriends, had frequent altercations</a><a name="ts_40193220_40198530_" > with their bosses, and moved from place to place because she could not tolerate her roommates,</a><a name="ts_40199130_40207840_" > nor they her. I never understood how she had mobilized enough stability and concentration to earn a Ph.D.</a><a name="ts_40207960_40214100_" > in psychology from a reputable graduate school. Maggie had been referred to a therapy group I was</a><a name="ts_40214100_40219300_" > running for women with similar problems. During her second meeting, she told us that her father had</a><a name="ts_40219300_40226260_" > raped her twice, once when she was five years old and once when she was seven. She was convinced it had</a><a name="ts_40226260_40232390_" > been her fault. She loved her daddy, she explained, and she must have been so seductive that he could</a><a name="ts_40232390_40239050_" > not control himself. Listening to her, I thought, she might not blame her father, but she sure is blaming</a><a name="ts_40239050_40243968_" > just about everybody else, including her previous therapists, for not helping her get better.</a><a name="ts_40243968_40245600_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_40245600_40250800_" > Like many trauma survivors, she told one story with words and another in her actions,</a><a name="ts_40250800_40257770_" > in which she kept replaying various aspects of her trauma. Then one day, Maggie came to the group</a><a name="ts_40257770_40263510_" > eager to discuss a remarkable experience she&#x27;d had the previous weekend at an EMDR training for</a><a name="ts_40263510_40270670_" > professionals. At that time, I&#x27;d heard only that EMDR was a new fad in which therapists wiggled their</a><a name="ts_40270670_40276832_" > fingers in front of patients&#x27; eyes. To me and my academic colleagues, it sounded like yet another of the</a><a name="ts_40277440_40282600_" > crazes that have always plagued psychiatry. And I was convinced that this would turn out to be</a><a name="ts_40282600_40288710_" > another of Maggie&#x27;s misadventures. Maggie told us that during her EMDR session, she had vividly</a><a name="ts_40288710_40295580_" > remembered her father&#x27;s rape when she was seven, remembered it from inside her child&#x27;s body. She could</a><a name="ts_40295580_40302310_" > feel physically how small she was. She could feel her father&#x27;s huge body on top of her and could smell</a><a name="ts_40302310_40309550_" > the alcohol in his breath. And yet, she told us, even as she relived the incident, she was able to</a><a name="ts_40309550_40316720_" > observe it from the point of view of her 29 year old self. She burst into tears. I was such a little</a><a name="ts_40316720_40324520_" > girl. How could a huge man do this to a little girl? She cried for a while and then said, it&#x27;s over</a><a name="ts_40324520_40331640_" > now. I now know what happened. It wasn&#x27;t my fault. I was a little girl and there was nothing I could do</a><a name="ts_40331640_40339780_" > to keep him from molesting me. I was astounded. I had been looking for a long time for a way to help</a><a name="ts_40339780_40347070_" > people revisit their traumatic past without becoming re-traumatized. It seemed that Maggie had had an</a><a name="ts_40347790_40355330_" > experience as lifelike as a flashback and yet had not been hijacked by it. Could EMDR make it safe</a><a name="ts_40355330_40361490_" > for people to access the imprints of trauma? Could it then transform them into memories of events</a><a name="ts_40361490_40369420_" > that had happened far in the past? Maggie had a few more EMDR sessions and remained in our group</a><a name="ts_40369420_40376480_" > long enough for us to see how she changed. She was much less angry, but she kept that sardonic sense</a><a name="ts_40376480_40381510_" > of humor that I enjoyed so much. A few months later, she got involved with a very different kind</a><a name="ts_40381510_40386970_" > of man than she&#x27;d ever been attracted to before. She left the group, announcing that she&#x27;d resolved</a><a name="ts_40386970_40398048_" > her trauma, and I decided it was time for me to get trained in EMDR. EMDR, first exposures. Like</a><a name="ts_40398048_40400096_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_40400096_40409500_" > many scientific advances, EMDR originated with a chance observation. One day in 1987, psychologist</a><a name="ts_40409500_40415580_" > Francine Shapiro was walking through a park, preoccupied with some painful memories, when she noticed</a><a name="ts_40415580_40422140_" > that rapid eye movements produced a dramatic relief from her distress. How could a major treatment</a><a name="ts_40422140_40428140_" > modality grow from such a brief experience? How is it possible that such a simple process</a><a name="ts_40428140_40435360_" > had not been noted before? Initially skeptical about her observation, she subjected her method</a><a name="ts_40435360_40441240_" > to years of experimentation and research, gradually building it into a standardized process that could</a><a name="ts_40441240_40448780_" > be taught and tested in controlled studies. I arrived from my first EMDR training in need of some</a><a name="ts_40448780_40454820_" > trauma processing myself. A few weeks earlier, the Jesuit priest who was chair of my department at</a><a name="ts_40454820_40460390_" > Massachusetts General Hospital had suddenly shut down the trauma clinic, leaving us scrambling for</a><a name="ts_40460390_40467590_" > a new site and new funds to treat our patients, train our students, and conduct our research. At around</a><a name="ts_40467590_40472630_" > the same time, my friend Frank Putnam, who was doing the long-term study of sexually abused girls</a><a name="ts_40472630_40479060_" > that I discussed in Chapter 10, was fired from the National Institutes of Health. And Rick Cluft,</a><a name="ts_40479260_40484470_" > the country&#x27;s foremost expert on dissociation, lost his unit at the Institute of the Pennsylvania</a><a name="ts_40484470_40492672_" > Hospital. It might have all been a coincidence, but it felt as if my whole world was under attack.</a><a name="ts_40492672_40494912_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_40494912_40500820_" > My distress about the trauma clinic seemed like a good test for my EMDR trial. While I was following</a><a name="ts_40500820_40507970_" > my partner&#x27;s fingers with my eyes, a rapid succession of fuzzy childhood scenes came to mind. Intense family</a><a name="ts_40507970_40514310_" > dinner table conversations, confrontations with schoolmates during recess, throwing pebbles at a shed</a><a name="ts_40514310_40520640_" > window with my older brother. All of them, the sort of vivid, floating, hypnopompic images we experience</a><a name="ts_40520640_40528900_" > when we slumber late on a Sunday morning, then forget the moment we fully awaken. After about</a><a name="ts_40528900_40535020_" > half an hour, my fellow trainee and I revisited the scene in which my boss told me that he was closing</a><a name="ts_40535020_40543808_" > my clinic. Now I felt resigned. Okay, it happened. And now it&#x27;s time to move on. I never looked back.</a><a name="ts_40544672_40551310_" > The clinic later reconstituted itself and has thrived ever since. Was EMDR the sole reason I was able to</a><a name="ts_40551310_40557210_" > let go of my anger and distress? Of course, I&#x27;ll never know for certain, but my mental journey,</a><a name="ts_40557210_40563410_" > through unrelated childhood scenes to putting the episode to rest, was unlike anything I had</a><a name="ts_40563410_40570560_" > experienced in talk therapy. What happened next, when it was my turn to administer EMDR,</a><a name="ts_40571488_40577510_" > was even more intriguing. We rotated to a different group and my new fellow student,</a><a name="ts_40577630_40582290_" > whom I&#x27;d never met before, told me he wanted to address some painful childhood incidents involving</a><a name="ts_40582290_40587710_" > his father, but he did not want to discuss them. I had never worked on anybody&#x27;s trauma without</a><a name="ts_40587710_40595240_" > knowing the story, and I was annoyed and flustered by his refusal to share any details. While I was moving</a><a name="ts_40595240_40600240_" > my fingers in front of his eyes, he looked intensely distressed. He began sobbing,</a><a name="ts_40600300_40605140_" > and his breathing became rapid and shallow. But each time I asked him the questions that the</a><a name="ts_40605140_40611330_" > protocol called for, he refused to tell me what came to his mind. At the end of our 45-minute session,</a><a name="ts_40611470_40616090_" > the first thing my colleague said was that he&#x27;d found dealing with me so unpleasant that he would</a><a name="ts_40616090_40622970_" > never refer a patient to me. Otherwise, he remarked, the EMDR session had resolved the matter of his father&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_40622970_40628670_" > abuse. While I was skeptical and suspected that his rudeness toward me was a carryover</a><a name="ts_40628670_40633600_" > from unresolved feelings toward his father, there was no question that he appeared much</a><a name="ts_40633600_40642950_" > more relaxed. I turned to my EMDR trainer, Gerald Puck, and told him how flummoxed I was. This man</a><a name="ts_40642950_40648920_" > clearly did not like me and had looked profoundly distressed during the EMDR session, but now he was</a><a name="ts_40648920_40654760_" > telling me that his long-standing misery was gone. How could I possibly know what he had or had not</a><a name="ts_40654760_40661980_" > resolved if he was unwilling to tell me what had happened during the session? Jerry smiled and asked</a><a name="ts_40661980_40665960_" > if by chance I had become a mental health professional in order to solve some of my own</a><a name="ts_40665960_40673250_" > personal issues. I confirmed that most people who knew me thought that might be the case. Then he asked</a><a name="ts_40673250_40678528_" > if I found it meaningful when people told me their trauma stories. Again, I had to agree with him. Then</a><a name="ts_40679488_40685400_" > he said, you know, Bessel, maybe you need to learn to put your voyeuristic tendencies on hold. If it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_40685400_40690870_" > important for you to hear trauma stories, why don&#x27;t you go to a bar, put a couple of dollars on the</a><a name="ts_40690870_40697360_" > table and say to your neighbor, I&#x27;ll buy your drink if you tell me your trauma story. But you</a><a name="ts_40697360_40701720_" > really need to know the difference between your desire to hear stories and your patient&#x27;s internal</a><a name="ts_40701720_40708020_" > process of healing. I took Jerry&#x27;s admonition to heart and ever since have enjoyed repeating it to</a><a name="ts_40708020_40715232_" > my students. I left my EMDR training preoccupied with three issues that fascinate me to this day.</a><a name="ts_40715232_40716288_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_40716288_40723220_" > One, EMDR loosens up something in the mind-brain that gives people rapid access to loosely associated</a><a name="ts_40723220_40728510_" > memories and images from their past, but seems to help them put the traumatic experience into a</a><a name="ts_40728510_40735424_" > larger context or perspective. Two, people may be able to heal from trauma without talking about it.</a><a name="ts_40736256_40741560_" > EMDR enables them to observe their experiences in a new way without verbal give and take with another</a><a name="ts_40741560_40748800_" > person. And three, EMDR can help even if the patient and the therapist do not have a trusting</a><a name="ts_40748800_40755930_" > relationship. This was particularly intriguing because trauma, understandably, rarely leaves people with an</a><a name="ts_40755930_40765650_" > open, trusting heart. In the years since, I have done EMDR with patients who spoke Swahili, Mandarin,</a><a name="ts_40766210_40776300_" > and Breton, all languages in which I can say only notice that, the key EMDR instruction. I always had a</a><a name="ts_40776300_40782830_" > translator available, but primarily to explain the steps of the process. Because EMDR doesn&#x27;t require</a><a name="ts_40782830_40789550_" > patients to speak about the intolerable or explain to a therapist why they feel so upset, it allows them to</a><a name="ts_40789550_40800160_" > stay fully focused on their internal experience with sometimes extraordinary results. Studying EMDR.</a><a name="ts_40800160_40802432_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_40802432_40808270_" > The trauma clinic was saved by a manager at the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health who had</a><a name="ts_40808270_40813850_" > followed our work with children and now asked us to take on the task of organizing the community trauma</a><a name="ts_40813850_40821250_" > response team for the Boston area. That was enough to cover our basic operations and the rest was supplied by</a><a name="ts_40821250_40827920_" > an energetic staff who loved what we were doing, including the newly discovered power of EMDR to cure</a><a name="ts_40827920_40833820_" > some of the patients whom we&#x27;d been unable to help before. My colleagues and I began to show one another</a><a name="ts_40833820_40840460_" > videotapes of our EMDR sessions with PTSD patients, which enabled us to observe dramatic week-by-week</a><a name="ts_40840460_40848100_" > improvements. We then started to formally measure their progress on a standard PTSD rating scale. We also</a><a name="ts_40848100_40854080_" > arranged with Elizabeth Matthew, a young neuroimaging specialist at the New England Deaconess Hospital,</a><a name="ts_40854848_40861530_" > to have 12 patients&#x27; brains scanned before and after their treatment. After only 3 EMDR sessions,</a><a name="ts_40861890_40868030_" > 8 of the 12 had shown a significant decrease in their PTSD scores. On their scans, we could see a sharp</a><a name="ts_40868030_40873190_" > increase in prefrontal lobe activation after treatment, as well as much more activity in the</a><a name="ts_40873190_40880040_" > anterior cingulate and the basal ganglia. This shift could account for the difference in how they now</a><a name="ts_40880040_40883860_" > experienced their trauma. One man reported,</a><a name="ts_40883860_40892320_" > I remember it as though it was a real memory, but it was more distant. Typically, I drowned in it,</a><a name="ts_40892864_40900128_" > but this time I was floating on top. I had the feeling that I was in control. A woman told us,</a><a name="ts_40900768_40907760_" > Before, I felt each and every step of it. Now, it&#x27;s like a hole instead of fragments, so it is more</a><a name="ts_40907760_40915870_" > manageable. The trauma had lost its immediacy and become a story about something that happened a long time</a><a name="ts_40915870_40923520_" > ago. We subsequently secured funding from the National Institutes of Mental Health to compare</a><a name="ts_40923520_40933152_" > the effects of EMDR with standard doses of Prozac or placebo. Of our 88 subjects, 30 received EMDR,</a><a name="ts_40933856_40942530_" > 28 Prozac, and the rest the sugar pill. As often happens, the people on placebo did well. After 8 weeks,</a><a name="ts_40942590_40949710_" > their 42% improvement was greater than that for many other treatments that are promoted as evidence-based.</a><a name="ts_40949710_40958170_" > The group on Prozac did slightly better than the placebo group, but barely so. This is typical of</a><a name="ts_40958170_40966160_" > most studies of drugs for PTSD. Simply showing up brings about a 30% to 42% improvement. When drugs</a><a name="ts_40966160_40974500_" > work, they add an additional 5 to 15%. However, the patients on EMDR did substantially better than those</a><a name="ts_40974500_40983450_" > on either Prozac or the placebo. After 8 EMDR sessions, 1 in 4 were completely cured. Their PTSD scores had</a><a name="ts_40983450_40990700_" > dropped to negligible levels, compared with 1 in 10 of the Prozac group. But the real difference</a><a name="ts_40990700_40997070_" > occurred over time. When we interviewed our subjects eight months later, 60% of those who had received</a><a name="ts_40997070_41004128_" > EMDR scored as being completely cured. As the great psychiatrist Milton Erickson said,</a><a name="ts_41004832_41011580_" > once you kick the log, the river will start flowing. Once people started to integrate their traumatic</a><a name="ts_41011580_41020240_" > memories, they spontaneously continued to improve. In contrast, all those who had taken Prozac relapsed when</a><a name="ts_41020240_41027920_" > they went off the drug. This study was significant because it demonstrated that a focused trauma-specific</a><a name="ts_41027920_41035800_" > therapy for PTSD, like EMDR, could be much more effective than medication. Other studies have</a><a name="ts_41035800_41043240_" > confirmed that if patients take Prozac or related drugs like Celexa, Paxil, and Zoloft, their PTSD symptoms</a><a name="ts_41043240_41051104_" > often improve, but only as long as they keep taking them. This makes drug treatment much more expensive in the long run.</a><a name="ts_41051104_41052256_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_41052256_41059110_" > Interestingly, despite Prozac status as a major antidepressant, in our study, EMDR also produced</a><a name="ts_41059110_41067936_" > a greater reduction in depression scores than taking the antidepressant. Another key finding of our study,</a><a name="ts_41068704_41074660_" > adults with histories of childhood trauma responded very differently to EMDR from those who were traumatized</a><a name="ts_41074660_41083600_" > as adults. At the end of eight weeks, almost half of the adult-onset group that received EMDR scored as</a><a name="ts_41083600_41089568_" > completely cured, while only 9% of the child abuse group showed such pronounced improvement.</a><a name="ts_41089568_41090784_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_41090784_41097110_" > Eight months later, the cure rate was 73% for the adult-onset group, compared with 25% for those</a><a name="ts_41097110_41103680_" > with histories of child abuse.

Eight weeks</a><a name="ts_41131750_41140900_" > of therapy of any kind is rarely sufficient to resolve the legacy of long-standing trauma. As of 2014,</a><a name="ts_41141660_41148480_" > our EMDR study had the most positive outcome of any published study of people who developed their PTSD in</a><a name="ts_41148480_41154630_" > reaction to the traumatic event as an adult. But despite these results, and those of dozens of</a><a name="ts_41154630_41161230_" > other studies, many of my colleagues continued to be skeptical about EMDR, perhaps because it seems</a><a name="ts_41161230_41171020_" > too good to be true, too simple to be so powerful. I surely can understand that sort of skepticism. EMDR is an</a><a name="ts_41171020_41179540_" > unusual procedure.

EMDR has since become one of the treatments for PTSD</a><a name="ts_41201940_41214150_" > sanctioned by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Is EMDR a form of exposure therapy? Some psychologists have</a><a name="ts_41214150_41220420_" > hypothesized that EMDR actually desensitizes people to the traumatic material and thus is related</a><a name="ts_41220420_41227168_" > to exposure therapy.

Hobson, together with his teacher, Michel Jouvet, was famous for discovering</a><a name="ts_42037850_42043440_" > where dreams are generated in the brain. And one of his research assistants, Robert Stickgold,</a><a name="ts_42043900_42049640_" > was just then beginning to explore the function of dreams. I showed the group a videotape of a patient</a><a name="ts_42049640_42055480_" > who had suffered from severe PTSD for thirteen years after a terrible car accident and who,</a><a name="ts_42055660_42062360_" > in only two sessions of EMDR, had transformed from a helpless, panicked victim into a confident,</a><a name="ts_42062360_42069900_" > assertive woman. Bob was fascinated. A few weeks later, a friend of Stickgold&#x27;s family</a><a name="ts_42069900_42075380_" > became so depressed after the death of her cat that she had to be hospitalized. The attending</a><a name="ts_42075380_42080340_" > psychiatrist concluded that the cat&#x27;s death had triggered unresolved memories of the death of the</a><a name="ts_42080340_42087136_" > woman&#x27;s mother when she was twelve. And he connected her with Roger Solomon, a well-known EMDR trainer,</a><a name="ts_42087712_42092120_" > who treated her successfully. Afterwards, she called Stickgold and said,</a><a name="ts_42092120_42099104_" > Bob, you have to study this. It&#x27;s really strange. It has to do with your brain, not your mind. Soon</a><a name="ts_42099104_42102304_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_42102304_42107390_" > afterward, an article appeared in the journal Dreaming, suggesting that EMDR was related to</a><a name="ts_42107390_42115620_" > rapid eye movement, REM sleep, the phase of sleep in which dreaming occurs.

As the article in Dreaming</a><a name="ts_42122900_42131680_" > pointed out, the eyes move rapidly back and forth in REM sleep, just as they do in EMDR. Increasing</a><a name="ts_42131680_42137780_" > our time in REM sleep reduces depression, while the less REM sleep we get, the more likely we are</a><a name="ts_42137780_42145940_" > to become depressed. Of course, PTSD is notoriously associated with disturbed sleep, and self-medication</a><a name="ts_42145940_42154040_" > with alcohol or drugs further disrupts REM sleep. During my time at the VA, my colleagues and I had</a><a name="ts_42154040_42159648_" > found that the veterans with PTSD frequently woke themselves up soon after going into REM sleep,</a><a name="ts_42160416_42166400_" > probably because they had activated a trauma fragment during a dream. Other researchers have</a><a name="ts_42166400_42171488_" > also noticed this phenomenon, but thought that it was irrelevant to understanding PTSD. Today,</a><a name="ts_42171488_42173240_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_42173240_42179264_" > we know that both deep sleep and REM sleep play important roles in how memories change over time.</a><a name="ts_42179264_42180800_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_42180800_42185380_" > The sleeping brain reshapes memory by increasing the imprint of emotionally relevant information,</a><a name="ts_42185600_42190870_" > while helping irrelevant material fade away. In a series of elegant studies,</a><a name="ts_42190870_42194970_" > Stickgold and his colleagues showed that the sleeping brain can even make sense</a><a name="ts_42194970_42201480_" > out of information whose relevance is unclear while we are awake, and integrate it into the larger</a><a name="ts_42201480_42211220_" > memory system. Dreams keep replaying, recombining, and reintegrating pieces of old memories for months</a><a name="ts_42211220_42217550_" > and even years. They constantly update the subterranean realities that determine what our waking</a><a name="ts_42217550_42226440_" > mind pays attention to, and perhaps most relevant to EMDR. In REM sleep, we activate more distant associations</a><a name="ts_42226440_42232500_" > than in either non-REM sleep than in either non-REM sleep or the normal waking state. For example,</a><a name="ts_42233344_42239120_" > when subjects are wakened from non-REM sleep and given a word association test, they give standard</a><a name="ts_42239120_42248520_" > responses. Hot for cold, hard for soft, etc. Waking from REM sleep, they make less conventional connections,</a><a name="ts_42248820_42258760_" > such as thief for wrong. They also solve simple anagrams more easily after REM sleep. This shift toward</a><a name="ts_42258760_42266340_" > activation of distant associations could explain why dreams are so bizarre. Stickgold,</a><a name="ts_42266440_42271460_" > Hobson, and their colleagues thus discovered that dreams help to forge new relationships between</a><a name="ts_42271460_42277952_" > apparently unrelated memories. Seeing novel connections is the cardinal feature of creativity.</a><a name="ts_42278784_42285020_" > As we&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s also essential to healing. The inability to recombine experiences is also one of the</a><a name="ts_42285020_42292070_" > striking features of PTSD. While Noam in Chapter 4 could imagine a trampoline to save future victims of</a><a name="ts_42292070_42299100_" > terrorism. Traumatized people are trapped in frozen associations. Anybody who wears a turban will try</a><a name="ts_42299100_42308250_" > to kill me. Any man who finds me attractive wants to rape me. Finally, Stickgold suggested a clear link</a><a name="ts_42308250_42313376_" > between EMDR and memory processing in dreams. He wrote,</a><a name="ts_42313984_42319808_" > If the bilateral stimulation of EMDR can alter brain states in a manner similar to that seen during REM sleep,</a><a name="ts_42320480_42326960_" > then there is now good evidence that EMDR should be able to take advantage of sleep-dependent processes,</a><a name="ts_42326960_42333210_" > which may be blocked or ineffective in PTSD sufferers, to allow effective memory processing</a><a name="ts_42333210_42341580_" > and trauma resolution. The basic EMDR instruction, hold that image in your mind and just watch my</a><a name="ts_42341580_42349020_" > fingers moving back and forth, may very well reproduce what happens in the dreaming brain.

While we don&#x27;t yet know precisely how EMDR works,</a><a name="ts_42427456_42433760_" > the same is true of Prozac. Prozac has an effect on serotonin, but whether its levels go up or down,</a><a name="ts_42433980_42442000_" > and in which brain cells, and why that makes people feel less afraid is still unclear. We likewise don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_42442000_42447820_" > know precisely why talking to a trusted friend gives such profound relief. And I&#x27;m surprised how few people</a><a name="ts_42447820_42456120_" > seem eager to explore that question. Clinicians have only one obligation, to do whatever they can to</a><a name="ts_42456120_42462060_" > help their patients get better. Because of this, clinical practice has always been a hotbed for</a><a name="ts_42462060_42470540_" > experimentation. Some experiments fail, some succeed, and some, like EMDR, dialectical behavior</a><a name="ts_42470540_42478340_" > therapy, and internal family systems therapy, go on to change the way therapy is practiced.

I knew we couldn&#x27;t do anything until I</a><a name="ts_42611300_42618110_" > could help her quiet down. Moving to within six feet of her and making sure she had unobstructed</a><a name="ts_42618110_42626510_" > access to the door, I encouraged her to take slightly deeper breaths.

She stealthily followed my movements,</a><a name="ts_42642330_42648730_" > her eyes still fixed on the floor. We spent about half an hour this way. From time to time,</a><a name="ts_42648730_42654240_" > I quietly asked her to notice how her feet felt against the floor, and how her chest expanded</a><a name="ts_42654240_42661170_" > and contracted with each breath.

Finally, she looked more relaxed,</a><a name="ts_42674770_42682350_" > and showed me the glimmer of a smile, a recognition that we both were in the room. I suggested that we stop</a><a name="ts_42682350_42687810_" > there for now. I&#x27;d made enough demands on her, and asked whether she would like to come back a week</a><a name="ts_42687810_42697300_" > later. She nodded, and muttered, you sure are weird. As I got to know Annie, I inferred from</a><a name="ts_42697300_42702640_" > the notes she wrote, and the drawing she gave me, that she had been dreadfully abused by both her</a><a name="ts_42702640_42708790_" > father and her mother as a very young child.

I learned that Annie was extraordinarily skilled,</a><a name="ts_42721472_42726180_" > and caring in her work with special needs kids. I tried out quite a few of the techniques</a><a name="ts_42726180_42730016_" > she told me about with the children in our own clinic, and found them extremely helpful. She</a><a name="ts_42730016_42731520_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_42731520_42736460_" > would talk freely about the children she taught, but would clam up immediately if we verged on her</a><a name="ts_42736460_42743860_" > relationships with adults. I knew she was married, but she barely mentioned her husband. She often</a><a name="ts_42743860_42750840_" > coped with disagreements and confrontations by making her mind disappear. When she felt overwhelmed,</a><a name="ts_42751060_42757260_" > she&#x27;d cut her arms and breasts with a razor blade. She had spent years in various forms of therapy,</a><a name="ts_42757260_42762300_" > and had tried many different medications, which had done little to help her deal with the imprints of</a><a name="ts_42762300_42769310_" > her horrendous past. She had also been admitted to several psychiatric hospitals to manage her</a><a name="ts_42769310_42775830_" > self-destructive behaviors, again, without much apparent benefit. In our early therapy sessions,</a><a name="ts_42776030_42780930_" > because Annie could only hint at what she was feeling and thinking before she would shut down and freeze,</a><a name="ts_42781920_42787810_" > we focused on calming the physiological chaos within. We used every technique that I had learned over the</a><a name="ts_42787810_42793510_" > years, like breathing with a focus on the out-breath, which activates the relaxing parasympathetic</a><a name="ts_42793510_42799640_" > nervous system. I also taught her to use her fingers to tap a sequence of acupressure points</a><a name="ts_42799640_42808090_" > on various parts of her body, a practice often taught under the name EFT, the acronym for emotional</a><a name="ts_42808090_42814690_" > freedom technique, which has been shown to help patients stay within the window of tolerance and often has</a><a name="ts_42814690_42824680_" > positive effects on PTSD symptoms. The legacy of inescapable shock. Because we can now identify the brain</a><a name="ts_42824680_42829940_" > circuits involved in the alarm system. We know more or less what was happening in Annie&#x27;s brain as she</a><a name="ts_42829940_42836480_" > sat that first day in my waiting room. Her smoke detector, her amygdala, had been rewired to intercept</a><a name="ts_42836480_42842530_" > certain situations as harbingers of life-threatening danger, and it was sending urgent signals to her</a><a name="ts_42842530_42851350_" > survival brain to fight, freeze, or flee. Annie had all these reactions simultaneously. She was visibly agitated</a><a name="ts_42851350_42860680_" > and mentally shut down. As we&#x27;ve seen, broken alarm systems can manifest in various ways, and if your smoke</a><a name="ts_42860680_42867020_" > detector malfunctions, you cannot trust the accuracy of your perceptions. For example, when Annie</a><a name="ts_42867020_42871680_" > started to like me, she began to look forward to our meetings, but she would arrive at my office</a><a name="ts_42871680_42878240_" > in an intense panic. One day, she had a flashback of feeling excited that her father was coming home</a><a name="ts_42878240_42885980_" > soon, but later that evening, he molested her. For the first time, she realized that her mind</a><a name="ts_42886800_42892640_" > automatically associated excitement about seeing someone she loved with the terror of being molested.</a><a name="ts_42892640_42895232_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_42895232_42899600_" > Small children are particularly adept at compartmentalizing experience, so that in</a><a name="ts_42899600_42904930_" > Annie&#x27;s natural love for her father and her dread of his assaults were held in separate states of</a><a name="ts_42904930_42910360_" > consciousness. As an adult, Annie blamed herself for her abuse because she believed that the loving,</a><a name="ts_42910560_42917216_" > excited little girl she once was had led her father on, that she had brought the molestation upon herself.</a><a name="ts_42917216_42918880_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_42918880_42923990_" > Her rational mind told her this was nonsense, but this belief emanated from deep within her emotional,</a><a name="ts_42923990_42930780_" > survival brain from the basic wiring of her limbic system.

The numbing within. One of the ways the memory of helplessness is</a><a name="ts_42947340_42954960_" > stored is as muscle tension or feelings of disintegration in the affected body areas. Head, back, and limbs in</a><a name="ts_42954960_42962530_" > accident victims, vagina and rectum in victims of sexual abuse. The lives of many trauma survivors come to</a><a name="ts_42962530_42969340_" > revolve around bracing against the neutralizing unwanted sensory experiences. And most people I</a><a name="ts_42969340_42977180_" > see in my practice have become experts in such self-numbing. They may become serially obese or</a><a name="ts_42977180_42985510_" > anorexic or addicted to exercise or work. At least half of all traumatized people try to dull their intolerable</a><a name="ts_42985510_42993380_" > inner world with drugs or alcohol. The flip side of numbing is sensation-seeking. Many people cut</a><a name="ts_42993380_42999450_" > themselves to make the numbing go away while others try bungee jumping or high-risk activities</a><a name="ts_42999450_43007080_" > like prostitution and gambling. Any of these methods can give them a false and paradoxical feeling of</a><a name="ts_43007080_43015870_" > control. When people are chronically angry or scared, constant muscle tension ultimately leads to spasms,</a><a name="ts_43016210_43023740_" > back pain, migraine headaches, fibromyalgia, and other forms of chronic pain. They may visit multiple</a><a name="ts_43023740_43030350_" > specialists, undergo extensive diagnostic tests, and be prescribed multiple medications, some of</a><a name="ts_43030350_43035488_" > which may provide temporary relief, but all of which fail to address the underlying issues.

The first two years of my therapy with Annie focused on helping her learn to</a><a name="ts_43050100_43056320_" > tolerate her physical sensations for what they were, just sensations in the present with a beginning,</a><a name="ts_43056320_43062130_" > a middle, and an end. We worked on helping her stay calm enough to notice what she felt without</a><a name="ts_43062130_43069020_" > judgment, so she could observe these unbidden images and feelings as residues of a terrible past</a><a name="ts_43069020_43076410_" > and not as unending threats to her life today. Patients like Annie continuously challenge us to find</a><a name="ts_43076410_43082560_" > new ways of helping people regulate their arousal and control their own physiology. That is how my trauma</a><a name="ts_43082560_43096700_" > center colleagues and I stumbled upon yoga, finding our way to yoga, bottom-up regulation. Our involvement with yoga</a><a name="ts_43096700_43103490_" > yoga started in 1998 when Jim Hopper and I first heard about a new biological marker, heart rate</a><a name="ts_43103490_43111320_" > variability, or HRV, that had recently been discovered to be a good measure of how well the autonomic nervous</a><a name="ts_43111320_43117240_" > system is working. As you&#x27;ll recall from chapter 5, the autonomic nervous system is our brain&#x27;s most</a><a name="ts_43117240_43124600_" > elementary survival system, its two branches regulating arousal throughout the body. Roughly speaking,</a><a name="ts_43124600_43131140_" > the sympathetic nervous system, the SNS uses chemicals like adrenaline to fuel the body and</a><a name="ts_43131140_43139720_" > brain to take action, while the parasympathetic nervous system, the PNS, uses acetylcholine to help</a><a name="ts_43139720_43147810_" > regulate basic body functions like digestion, wound healing, and sleep and dream cycles. When we&#x27;re at</a><a name="ts_43147810_43153430_" > our best, these two systems work closely together to keep us in an optimal state of engagement with our</a><a name="ts_43153430_43160810_" > environment and with ourselves. Heart rate variability measures the relative balance between the</a><a name="ts_43160810_43167640_" > sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems. When we inhale, we stimulate the SNS, which results in an</a><a name="ts_43167640_43176260_" > increase in heart rate. Exhalations stimulate the PNS, which decreases how fast the heart beats. In healthy</a><a name="ts_43176260_43183310_" > individuals, inhalations and exhalations produce steady rhythmical fluctuations in heart rate. Good heart rate</a><a name="ts_43183310_43193400_" > variability is a measure of basic well-being. Why is HRV important? When our autonomic nervous system is well</a><a name="ts_43193400_43198220_" > balanced, we have a reasonable degree of control over our response to minor frustrations and</a><a name="ts_43198220_43204960_" > disappointments, enabling us to calmly assess what&#x27;s going on when we feel insulted or left out.</a><a name="ts_43204960_43206336_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_43206336_43212350_" > Effective arousal modulation gives us control over our impulses and emotions. As long as we manage to</a><a name="ts_43212350_43219840_" > stay calm, we can choose how we want to respond. Individuals with poorly modulated autonomic nervous systems</a><a name="ts_43219840_43225570_" > are easily thrown off balance, both mentally and physically. Since the autonomic nervous system</a><a name="ts_43225570_43232690_" > organizes arousal in both body and brain, poor HRV, that is, a lack of fluctuation in heart rate</a><a name="ts_43232690_43238270_" > in response to breathing, not only has negative effects on thinking and feeling, but also on how</a><a name="ts_43238270_43244450_" > the body responds to stress. Lack of coherence between breathing and heart rate makes people vulnerable to</a><a name="ts_43244450_43251910_" > a variety of physical illnesses such as heart disease and cancer, in addition to mental problems such as</a><a name="ts_43251910_43259360_" > depression and PTSD. In order to study this issue further, we acquired a machine to measure HRV and</a><a name="ts_43259936_43267300_" > started to put bands around the chests of research subjects with and without PTSD to record the depth</a><a name="ts_43267300_43273376_" > and rhythm of their breathing while little monitors attached to their earlobes picked up their pulse.</a><a name="ts_43273376_43275968_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_43275968_43284260_" > After we tested about 60 subjects, it became clear that people with PTSD have unusually low HRV. In other words,</a><a name="ts_43284260_43292930_" > in PTSD, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are out of sync. This added a new twist</a><a name="ts_43292930_43299940_" > to the complicated trauma story. We confirmed that yet another brain regulatory system was not</a><a name="ts_43299940_43306690_" > functioning as it should. Failure to keep this system in balance is one explanation why traumatized</a><a name="ts_43306690_43314610_" > people like Annie are so vulnerable to over-respond to relatively minor stresses. The biological systems that</a><a name="ts_43314610_43323800_" > are meant to help us cope with the vagaries of life fail to meet the challenge. Our next scientific</a><a name="ts_43323800_43331560_" > question was, is there a way for people to improve their HRV? I had a personal incentive to explore this</a><a name="ts_43331560_43337900_" > question as I had discovered that my own HRV was not nearly robust enough to guarantee long-term</a><a name="ts_43337900_43345340_" > physical health. An internet search turned up studies showing that marathon running markedly increased</a><a name="ts_43345340_43353180_" > HRV. Sadly, that was of little use since neither I nor our patients were good candidates for the Boston</a><a name="ts_43353180_43361180_" > marathon. Google also listed 17,000 yoga sites claiming that yoga improved HRV, but we were</a><a name="ts_43361180_43367000_" > unable to find any supporting studies. Yogis may have developed a wonderful method to help people find</a><a name="ts_43367000_43372680_" > internal balance and health, but back in 1998, not much work had been done on evaluating their claims</a><a name="ts_43372680_43379424_" > with the tools of the Western medical tradition. Since then, however, scientific methods have confirmed</a><a name="ts_43380000_43385664_" > that changing the way one breathes can improve problems with anger, depression, and anxiety,</a><a name="ts_43386496_43392330_" > and that yoga can positively affect such wide-ranging medical problems as high blood pressure, elevated</a><a name="ts_43392330_43399940_" > stress hormone secretion, asthma, and lower back pain. However, no psychiatric journal had published</a><a name="ts_43399940_43407710_" > a scientific study of yoga for PTSD until our own work appeared in 2014. As it happened, a few days after our</a><a name="ts_43407710_43414368_" > internet search, a lanky yoga teacher named David Emerson walked through the front door of the trauma center.</a><a name="ts_43415360_43421310_" > He told us that he developed a modified form of hatha yoga to deal with PTSD and that he&#x27;d been</a><a name="ts_43421310_43427616_" > holding classes for veterans at a local vet center and for women in the Boston area rape crisis center.</a><a name="ts_43427616_43428736_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_43428736_43435072_" > Would we be interested in working with him? Dave&#x27;s visit eventually grew into a very active yoga program,</a><a name="ts_43435840_43441030_" > and in due course, we received the first grant from the National Institutes of Health to study the effects</a><a name="ts_43441030_43449120_" > of yoga on PTSD. Dave&#x27;s work also contributed to my developing my own regular yoga practice and becoming a</a><a name="ts_43449120_43453730_" > frequent teacher at Kripalu, a yoga center in the Berkshire mountains in western Massachusetts.</a><a name="ts_43453730_43454976_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_43454976_43464020_" > Along the way, my own HRV pattern improved as well. In choosing to explore yoga to improve HRV,</a><a name="ts_43464200_43471010_" > we were taking an expansive approach to the problem. We could simply have used any of a number of reasonably</a><a name="ts_43471010_43476430_" > priced handheld devices that train people to slow their breathing and synchronize it with their heart rate,</a><a name="ts_43476590_43484030_" > resulting in a state of cardiac coherence. Today, there are a variety of apps that can help improve</a><a name="ts_43484030_43490780_" > HRV with the aid of a smartphone. In our clinic, we have workstations where patients can train their</a><a name="ts_43490780_43497160_" > HRV, and I urge all my patients who, for one reason or another, cannot practice yoga, martial arts,</a><a name="ts_43497300_43508010_" > or Qigong to train themselves at home, exploring yoga. Our decision to study yoga led us deeper into</a><a name="ts_43508010_43515060_" > trauma&#x27;s impact on the body. Our first experimental yoga classes met in a room generously donated by a</a><a name="ts_43515060_43522890_" > nearby studio. David Emerson and his colleagues Dana Moore and Jody Carey volunteered as instructors,</a><a name="ts_43522890_43528672_" > and my research team figured out how we could best measure yoga&#x27;s effects on psychological functioning.</a><a name="ts_43528672_43529984_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_43529984_43534940_" > We put flyers in neighborhood supermarkets and laundromats to advertise our classes and interviewed</a><a name="ts_43534940_43542600_" > dozens of people who called in response. Ultimately, we selected 37 women who had severe trauma histories</a><a name="ts_43542600_43550400_" > and who had already received many years of therapy without much benefit. Half the volunteers were</a><a name="ts_43550400_43555270_" > selected at random for the yoga group, while the others would receive a well-established mental health</a><a name="ts_43555270_43562510_" > treatment, dialectical behavior therapy, DBT, which teaches people how to apply mindfulness to stay calm</a><a name="ts_43562510_43571120_" > and in control. Finally, we commissioned an engineer at MIT to build us a complicated computer that could measure</a><a name="ts_43571120_43578460_" > HRV simultaneously in eight different people. In each study group, there were multiple classes,</a><a name="ts_43578780_43586910_" > each with no more than eight participants. While yoga significantly improved arousal problems in PTSD</a><a name="ts_43587510_43592450_" > and dramatically improved our subjects&#x27; relationships to their bodies, with comments like,</a><a name="ts_43592610_43600580_" > I now take care of my body and I listen to what my body needs, eight weeks of DBT did not affect</a><a name="ts_43600580_43606650_" > their arousal levels or PTSD symptoms. Thus, our interest in yoga gradually</a><a name="ts_43606650_43613300_" > evolved from a focus on learning whether yoga can change HRV, which it can, to helping traumatized</a><a name="ts_43613300_43620800_" > people learn to comfortably inhabit their tortured bodies. Over time, we also started a yoga program</a><a name="ts_43620800_43625500_" > for Marines at Cabin Lejeune and have worked successfully with various other programs to</a><a name="ts_43625500_43632720_" > implement yoga programs for veterans with PTSD. Even though we have no formal research data on the veterans,</a><a name="ts_43632720_43633824_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_43633824_43639410_" > it looks as if yoga is at least as effective for them as it has been for the women in our studies.</a><a name="ts_43639410_43648544_" > All yoga programs consist of a combination of breathing practices, known as pranayama,</a><a name="ts_43648544_43649824_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_43649824_43657680_" > stretches or postures, known as asanas, and meditation. Different schools of yoga emphasize</a><a name="ts_43657680_43665790_" > variations in intensity and focus within these core components. For example, variations in the speed</a><a name="ts_43665790_43672896_" > and depth of breathing and use of the mouth, nostrils, and throat all produce different results,</a><a name="ts_43673696_43679552_" > and some techniques have powerful effects on energy.

We gradually introduce a limited number of classic postures. The emphasis is not on</a><a name="ts_43700530_43708840_" > getting the poses right, but on helping the participants notice which muscles are active at different times.

I thought that this might be an opportunity for Annie to develop a more caring</a><a name="ts_43796840_43804340_" > relationship with her body, and I urged her to try it. The first class was difficult. Merely being given</a><a name="ts_43804340_43811040_" > an adjustment by the instructor was so terrifying that she went home and slashed herself. Her malfunctioning</a><a name="ts_43811040_43819060_" > alarm system interpreted even a gentle touch on her back as an assault. At the same time,</a><a name="ts_43819180_43824780_" > Annie realized that yoga might offer her a way to liberate herself from the constant sense of danger</a><a name="ts_43824780_43832460_" > that she felt in her body. With my encouragement, she returned the following week. Annie had always</a><a name="ts_43832460_43839090_" > found it easier to write about her experiences than to talk about them. After her second yoga class,</a><a name="ts_43839230_43840000_" > she wrote to me,</a><a name="ts_43840000_43841600_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_43841600_43847380_" > I don&#x27;t know all of the reasons that yoga terrifies me so much, but I do know that it will be an incredible</a><a name="ts_43847380_43853950_" > source of healing for me, and that is why I&#x27;m working on myself to try it. Yoga is about looking</a><a name="ts_43853950_43860460_" > inward instead of outward and listening to my body, and a lot of my survival has been geared around</a><a name="ts_43860460_43868680_" > never doing those things.

It occurred to me how disconnected I must be from</a><a name="ts_43901990_43907390_" > my body when I cut it. When I was doing the poses, I noticed that my jaw and the whole area from where</a><a name="ts_43907390_43916270_" > my legs end to my belly button is where I am tight, tense and holding the pain and memories. Sometimes you have</a><a name="ts_43916270_43923440_" > asked me where I feel things, and I can&#x27;t even begin to locate them. But today, I felt those places very</a><a name="ts_43923440_43931400_" > clearly, and it made me want to cry in a gentle kind of way. The following month,</a><a name="ts_43931700_43937728_" > both of us went on vacation and, invited to stay in touch, Annie wrote to me again,</a><a name="ts_43937728_43939552_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_43939552_43944630_" > I&#x27;ve been doing yoga on my own in a room that overlooks the lake. I&#x27;m continuing to read the</a><a name="ts_43944630_43951360_" > book you lent me, Stephen Cope&#x27;s wonderful Yoga and the Quest for the True Self. It&#x27;s really</a><a name="ts_43951360_43955780_" > interesting to think about how much I have been refusing to listen to my body, which is such an</a><a name="ts_43955780_43961460_" > important part of who I am. Yesterday, when I did yoga, I thought about letting my body tell me the</a><a name="ts_43961460_43967010_" > story it wants to tell, and in the hip opening poses, there was a lot of pain and sadness.</a><a name="ts_43967010_43968608_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_43968608_43973960_" > I don&#x27;t think my mind is going to let really vivid images come up as long as I am away from home,</a><a name="ts_43974160_43981200_" > which is good. I think now about how unbalanced I have been, and about how hard I have tried to deny</a><a name="ts_43981200_43987232_" > the past, which is a part of my true self. There is so much I can learn if I am open to it,</a><a name="ts_43987872_43994400_" > and then I won&#x27;t have to fight myself every minute of every day. One of the hardest yoga positions</a><a name="ts_43994400_44000140_" > for Annie to tolerate was one that&#x27;s often called Happy Baby, in which you lie on your back with your</a><a name="ts_44000140_44005280_" > knees deeply bent and the soles of your feet pointing to the ceiling, while holding your</a><a name="ts_44005280_44013000_" > toes with your hands. This rotates the pelvis into a wide-open position. It&#x27;s easy to understand why this</a><a name="ts_44013000_44019320_" > would make a rape victim feel extremely vulnerable. Yet, as long as Happy Baby, or any posture that resembles</a><a name="ts_44019320_44026550_" > it, precipitates intense panic, it is difficult to be intimate. Learning how to comfortably assume</a><a name="ts_44026550_44036992_" > happy baby is a challenge for many patients in our yoga classes. Getting to know me. Cultivating</a><a name="ts_44037632_44044600_" > interoception. One of the clearest lessons from contemporary neuroscience is that our sense of</a><a name="ts_44044600_44050770_" > ourselves is anchored in a vital connection with our bodies. We don&#x27;t truly know ourselves unless we can</a><a name="ts_44050770_44057660_" > feel and interpret our physical sensations. We need to register and act on these sensations to navigate</a><a name="ts_44057660_44066520_" > safely through life. While numbing or compensatory sensation-seeking may make life tolerable, the price you pay</a><a name="ts_44066520_44071900_" > is that you lose awareness of what is going on inside your body and, with that, the sense of being</a><a name="ts_44071900_44082040_" > fully, sensually, alive. In Chapter 6, I discussed alexithymia, the technical term for not being able</a><a name="ts_44082040_44090040_" > to identify what is going on inside oneself. People who suffer from alexithymia tend to feel physically</a><a name="ts_44090040_44097550_" > uncomfortable but cannot describe exactly what the problem is. As a result, they often have multiple vague</a><a name="ts_44097550_44104820_" > and distressing physical complaints that doctors can&#x27;t diagnose. In addition, they can&#x27;t figure out</a><a name="ts_44104820_44110650_" > for themselves what they&#x27;re really feeling about any given situation or what makes them feel better or</a><a name="ts_44110650_44117950_" > worse. This is the result of numbing, which keeps them from anticipating and responding to the ordinary</a><a name="ts_44117950_44126730_" > demands of their bodies in quiet, mindful ways. At the same time, it muffles the everyday sensory delights of</a><a name="ts_44126730_44135330_" > experiences like music, touch, and light, which imbue life with value. Yoga turned out to be a terrific</a><a name="ts_44135330_44142010_" > way to regain a relationship with the interior world and, with it, a caring, loving, sensual relationship</a><a name="ts_44142010_44150720_" > to the self. If you are not aware of what your body needs, you can&#x27;t take care of it. If you don&#x27;t feel</a><a name="ts_44150720_44157400_" > hunger, you can&#x27;t nourish yourself. If you mistake anxiety for hunger, you may eat too much. And if you can&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_44157400_44164150_" > feel when you&#x27;re satiated, you&#x27;ll keep eating. This is why cultivating sensory awareness is such a critical</a><a name="ts_44164150_44170160_" > aspect of trauma recovery. Most traditional therapies downplay or ignore the moment-to-moment</a><a name="ts_44170160_44176350_" > shifts in our inner sensory world. But these shifts carry the essence of the organism&#x27;s responses,</a><a name="ts_44176350_44182890_" > the emotional states that are imprinted in the body&#x27;s chemical profile, in the viscera, in the</a><a name="ts_44182890_44190570_" > contraction of the striated muscles of the face, throat, trunk, and limbs. Traumatized people need to</a><a name="ts_44190570_44196960_" > learn that they can tolerate their sensations, befriend their inner experiences, and cultivate new action</a><a name="ts_44196960_44203552_" > patterns. In yoga, you focus your attention on your breathing and on your sensations moment-to-moment.</a><a name="ts_44204384_44209290_" > You begin to notice the connection between your emotions and your body, perhaps how anxiety about</a><a name="ts_44209290_44215680_" > doing a pose actually throws you off balance. You begin to experiment with changing the way you feel.</a><a name="ts_44215680_44217056_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_44217056_44222150_" > Will taking a deep breath relieve the tension in your shoulder? Will focusing on your exhalations</a><a name="ts_44222150_44230550_" > produce a sense of calm? Simply noticing what you feel fosters emotional regulation, and it helps you to</a><a name="ts_44230550_44236720_" > stop trying to ignore what is going on inside you. As I often tell my students, the two most</a><a name="ts_44236720_44246440_" > important phrases in therapy, as in yoga, are, notice that, and what happens next. Once you start</a><a name="ts_44246440_44255140_" > approaching your body with curiosity, rather than with fear, everything shifts. Body awareness also</a><a name="ts_44255140_44262784_" > changes your sense of time.

The</a><a name="ts_44293408_44299550_" > teacher might say, we&#x27;ll be holding this position for 10 breaths. This helps you anticipate the end of</a><a name="ts_44299550_44306360_" > discomfort and strengthens your capacity to deal with physical and emotional distress.

One day I opened the door to my</a><a name="ts_44729590_44735390_" > waiting room and saw her standing there, provocatively, dressed in a miniskirt. Her hair dyed,</a><a name="ts_44735390_44743020_" > flaming red, with a cup of coffee in one hand, and a snarl on her face. You must be Dr. Vander Kulk,</a><a name="ts_44743420_44749420_" > she said. My name is Jane, and I came to warn you not to believe any of the lies that Mary has been</a><a name="ts_44749420_44756480_" > telling you. Can I come in and tell you about her? I was stunned, but fortunately kept myself from</a><a name="ts_44756480_44764500_" > confronting Jane and instead heard her out. Over the course of our session, I met not only Jane,</a><a name="ts_44764620_44771360_" > but also a hurt little girl and an angry male adolescent. That was the beginning of a long and</a><a name="ts_44772000_44780990_" > productive treatment. Mary was my first encounter with Dissociative Identity Disorder, known as DID,</a><a name="ts_44780990_44788840_" > which at that time was called Multiple Personality Disorder. As dramatic as its symptoms are,</a><a name="ts_44789220_44794950_" > the internal splitting and emergence of distinct identities experienced in DID represent only the</a><a name="ts_44794950_44800680_" > extreme end of the spectrum of mental life. The sense of being inhabited by warring impulses or parts</a><a name="ts_44800680_44806710_" > is common to all of us, but particularly to traumatized people who had to resort to extreme</a><a name="ts_44806710_44814120_" > measures in order to survive. Exploring, even befriending, those parts is an important component</a><a name="ts_44814600_44825080_" > of healing. Desperate times require desperate measures. We all know what happens when we feel</a><a name="ts_44825080_44831200_" > humiliated. We put all our energy into protecting ourselves, developing whatever survival strategies</a><a name="ts_44831200_44839170_" > we can. We may repress our feelings. We may get furious and plot revenge.

Many behaviors that are classified as</a><a name="ts_44846040_44852160_" > psychiatric problems, including some obsessions, compulsions, and panic attacks, as well as most</a><a name="ts_44852160_44859890_" > self-destructive behaviors started out as strategies for self-protection.

Viewing these symptoms as permanent disabilities</a><a name="ts_44872608_44878160_" > narrows the focus of treatment to finding the proper drug regimen, which can lead to lifelong dependence,</a><a name="ts_44879040_44885700_" > as though trauma survivors were like kidney patients on dialysis. It&#x27;s much more productive to see</a><a name="ts_44885700_44893720_" > aggression or depression, arrogance, or passivity as learned behaviors. Somewhere along the line,</a><a name="ts_44893820_44901390_" > the patient came to believe that he or she can survive only if he or she was tough, invisible, or absent,</a><a name="ts_44901550_44908096_" > or that it was safer to give up.

Every trauma survivor I&#x27;ve met is resilient in his or</a><a name="ts_44921290_44928340_" > her own way, and every one of their stories inspires awe at how people cope. Knowing how much energy the</a><a name="ts_44928340_44935400_" > sheer act of survival requires keeps me from being surprised at the price they often pay. The absence of</a><a name="ts_44935400_44943040_" > a loving relationship with their own bodies, minds, and souls. Coping takes its toll. For many children,</a><a name="ts_44943060_44948820_" > it&#x27;s safer to hate themselves than to risk their relationship with their caregivers by expressing anger or by</a><a name="ts_44948820_44954780_" > running away. As a result, abused children are likely to grow up believing that they are fundamentally</a><a name="ts_44954780_44960800_" > unlovable. That was the only way their young minds could explain why they were treated so badly. They</a><a name="ts_44960800_44962144_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_44962144_44970592_" > survive by denying, ignoring, and splitting off large chunks of reality. They forget the abuse.

If you were abused as a child,</a><a name="ts_44979136_44985690_" > you are likely to have a childlike part living inside you that is frozen in time, still holding fast to this</a><a name="ts_44985690_44992960_" > kind of self-loathing and denial. Many adults who survive terrible experiences are caught in the</a><a name="ts_44992960_44999510_" > same trap. Pushing away intense feelings can be highly adaptive in the short run. It may help you</a><a name="ts_44999510_45005100_" > preserve your dignity and independence.

So another protective</a><a name="ts_45045170_45051880_" > part steps in to create a diversion. He gets angry and, having no idea what set him off,</a><a name="ts_45051880_45057780_" > he thinks he&#x27;s mad about something his girlfriend did. Of course, if he keeps blowing up at her,</a><a name="ts_45057920_45065100_" > and subsequent girlfriends, he will become more and more isolated. But he may never realize that</a><a name="ts_45065100_45072260_" > a traumatized part is triggered by passivity and that another part, an angry manager, is stepping in</a><a name="ts_45072260_45080720_" > to protect that vulnerable part.

As we saw in chapter 13, a central task for recovery from trauma is to learn to live with the</a><a name="ts_45089490_45095580_" > memories of the past without being overwhelmed by them in the present. But most survivors, including</a><a name="ts_45095580_45101860_" > those who are functioning well, even brilliantly in some aspects of their lives, face another even</a><a name="ts_45101860_45109088_" > greater challenge, reconfiguring a brain-mind system that was constructed to cope with the worst.</a><a name="ts_45109088_45110944_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_45110944_45116060_" > Just as we need to revisit traumatic memories in order to integrate them, we need to revisit the</a><a name="ts_45116060_45126464_" > parts of ourselves that developed the defensive habits that helped us to survive.

Michael Gazaniga, who conducted pioneering split-brain research,</a><a name="ts_45299090_45305450_" > concluded that the mind is composed of semi-autonomous functioning modules, each of which has a special</a><a name="ts_45305450_45314280_" > role. In his book, The Social Brain, 1985, he writes, but what of the idea that the self is</a><a name="ts_45314280_45321200_" > not a unified being and there may exist within us several realms of consciousness? From our split-brain</a><a name="ts_45321200_45327040_" > studies, the new idea emerges that there are literally several selves and they do not necessarily</a><a name="ts_45327040_45334710_" > converse with each other internally. MIT scientist Marvin Minsky, a pioneer of artificial intelligence,</a><a name="ts_45334930_45341740_" > declared, the legend of the single self can only divert us from the target of that inquiry. It can make sense to</a><a name="ts_45341740_45347440_" > think there exists inside your brain a society of different minds. Like members of a family,</a><a name="ts_45347940_45352850_" > the different minds can work together to help each other, each still having its own mental experiences</a><a name="ts_45353350_45361420_" > that the others never know about.

There are several such treatment approaches,</a><a name="ts_45372190_45376650_" > including the structural dissociation model developed by my Dutch colleagues,</a><a name="ts_45376830_45382710_" > Ono van der Haart and Ellert Nijenhaus, and Atlanta-based Cathy Steele, that is widely practiced in</a><a name="ts_45382710_45390550_" > Europe, and Richard Cluft&#x27;s work in the United States. Twenty years after working with Mary,</a><a name="ts_45391328_45399050_" > I met Richard Schwartz, the developer of Internal Family Systems Therapy, known as IFS. It was through his work</a><a name="ts_45399050_45404670_" > that Minsky&#x27;s family metaphor truly came to life for me and offered a systematic way to work with the</a><a name="ts_45404670_45405770_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_45405770_45408600_" > mental health and mental health and mental health and mental health and mental health. At the core of</a><a name="ts_45408600_45413480_" > IFS is the notion that the mind of each of us is like a family in which the members have different</a><a name="ts_45413480_45421140_" > levels of maturity, excitability, wisdom, and pain. The parts form a network or system in which change</a><a name="ts_45421140_45429170_" > in any one part will affect all the others. The IFS model helped me realize that dissociation occurs on</a><a name="ts_45429170_45436320_" > a continuum. In trauma, the self-system breaks down, and parts of the self become polarized and go to war with one</a><a name="ts_45436320_45444920_" > another. Self-loathing coexists and fights with grandiosity. Loving care with hatred. Numbing and</a><a name="ts_45444920_45454190_" > passivity with rage and aggression. These extreme parts bear the burden of the trauma. In IFS, a part is</a><a name="ts_45454190_45460630_" > considered not just a passing emotional state or customary thought pattern, but a distinct mental</a><a name="ts_45460630_45468750_" > system with its own history, abilities, needs, and worldview. Trauma injects parts with beliefs and</a><a name="ts_45468750_45476010_" > emotions that hijack them out of their naturally valuable state. For example, we all have parts</a><a name="ts_45476010_45481760_" > that are childlike and fun. When we are abused, these are the parts that are hurt the most, and they</a><a name="ts_45482304_45490960_" > become frozen, carrying the pain, terror, and betrayal of abuse. This burden makes them toxic. Parts of</a><a name="ts_45490960_45499410_" > ourselves that we need to deny at all costs because they are locked away inside. IFS calls them the exiles.</a><a name="ts_45499410_45507570_" > At this point, other parts organize to protect the internal family from the exiles. These protectors</a><a name="ts_45507570_45515040_" > keep the toxic parts away, but in doing so, they take on some of the energy of the abuser. Critical and</a><a name="ts_45515680_45522050_" > perfectionistic managers can make sure we never get close to anyone or drive us to be relentlessly</a><a name="ts_45522050_45530680_" > productive. Another group of protectors, which IFS calls firefighters, are emergency responders, acting</a><a name="ts_45530680_45537410_" > impulsively whenever an experience triggers an exiled emotion. Each split-off part holds different</a><a name="ts_45537410_45544710_" > memories, beliefs, beliefs, and physical sensations. Some hold the shame, others the rage, some the</a><a name="ts_45544710_45551790_" > pleasure and excitement, another the intense loneliness or the abject compliance. These are all aspects of</a><a name="ts_45551790_45560680_" > the abuse experience. The critical insight is that all these parts have a function to protect the self</a><a name="ts_45560680_45569230_" > from feeling the full terror of annihilation. Children who act out their pain rather than locking it down are</a><a name="ts_45569230_45580020_" > often diagnosed with oppositional defiant behavior, attachment disorder, or conduct disorder. But these</a><a name="ts_45580020_45586080_" > labels ignore the fact that rage and withdrawal are only facets of a whole range of desperate attempts</a><a name="ts_45586080_45591480_" > at survival. Trying to control the child&#x27;s behavior while failing to address the underlying issue,</a><a name="ts_45591640_45599910_" > the abuse, leads to treatments that are ineffective, at best, and harmful, at worst. As they grow up,</a><a name="ts_45599910_45605270_" > their parts do not spontaneously integrate into a coherent personality, but continue to lead a</a><a name="ts_45605270_45614220_" > relatively autonomous existence. Parts that are out may be entirely unaware of the other parts of the</a><a name="ts_45614220_45620800_" > system. Most of the men I evaluated with regard to their childhood molestation by Catholic priests</a><a name="ts_45621600_45629120_" > took anabolic steroids and spent an inordinate amount of time in the gym pumping iron. These compulsive</a><a name="ts_45629120_45636590_" > bodybuilders lived in a masculine culture of sweat, football, and beer, where weakness and fear were</a><a name="ts_45636590_45646190_" > carefully concealed. Only after they felt safe with me did I meet the terrified kids inside. Patients</a><a name="ts_45646190_45653050_" > may also dislike the parts that are out. The parts that are angry, destructive, or critical. But IFS</a><a name="ts_45653050_45659090_" > offers a framework for understanding them. And, also important, talking about them in a non-pathologizing</a><a name="ts_45659090_45665760_" > way. Recognizing that each part is stuck with burdens from the past and respecting its function in</a><a name="ts_45665760_45672300_" > the overall system makes it feel less threatening or overwhelming. As Schwartz states,</a><a name="ts_45672300_45674016_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_45674016_45678336_" > If one accepts the basic idea that people have an innate drive toward nurturing their own health,</a><a name="ts_45679008_45683950_" > this implies that when people have chronic problems, something gets in the way of accessing</a><a name="ts_45683950_45690590_" > inner resources. Recognizing this, the role of therapists is to collaborate rather than teach,</a><a name="ts_45691050_45698440_" > confront, or fill holes in your psyche. The first step in this collaboration is to assure the internal</a><a name="ts_45698440_45705690_" > system that all parts are welcome and that all of them, even those that are suicidal or destructive,</a><a name="ts_45706592_45713440_" > were formed in an attempt to protect the self-system, no matter how much they now seem to threaten it.</a><a name="ts_45713440_45717632_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_45717632_45725030_" > self-leadership. IFS recognizes that the cultivation of mindful self-leadership is the foundation for</a><a name="ts_45725030_45731150_" > healing from trauma. Mindfulness not only makes it possible to survey our internal landscape with</a><a name="ts_45731150_45736448_" > compassion and curiosity, but can also actively steer us in the right direction for self-care.</a><a name="ts_45736448_45737760_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_45737760_45744590_" > All systems, families, organizations, or nations can operate effectively only if they have clearly</a><a name="ts_45744590_45756370_" > defined and competent leadership. The internal family is no different. All facets of ourselves need to be</a><a name="ts_45756370_45761750_" > redistribute the available resources and supply a vision for the whole that takes all the parts into</a><a name="ts_45761750_45770310_" > account. As Richard Schwartz explains, the internal system of an abuse victim differs from the non-abuse</a><a name="ts_45770310_45776220_" > system with regard to the consistent absence of effective leadership, the extreme rules under which the</a><a name="ts_45776220_45782830_" > parts function, and the absence of any consistent balance or harmony. Typically, the parts operate around</a><a name="ts_45782830_45789170_" > outdated assumptions and beliefs derived from the childhood abuse, believing, for example, that it is still</a><a name="ts_45789170_45798000_" > extremely dangerous to reveal secrets about childhood experiences which were endured. What happens</a><a name="ts_45798000_45806950_" > when the self is no longer in charge? IFS calls this blending, a condition in which the self identifies</a><a name="ts_45806950_45815690_" > with a part, as in, I want to kill myself, or I hate you. Notice the difference from a part of me wishes</a><a name="ts_45815690_45824140_" > that I were dead, or a part of me triggers when you do that and makes me want to kill you. Schwartz makes two</a><a name="ts_45824140_45829930_" > assertions that extend the concept of mindfulness into the realm of active leadership. The first is</a><a name="ts_45829930_45834830_" > that this self does not need to be cultivated or developed. Beneath the surface of the protective</a><a name="ts_45834830_45842304_" > parts of trauma survivors, there exists an undamaged essence, a self that is confident, curious, and calm,</a><a name="ts_45842848_45847650_" > a self that has been sheltered from destruction by the various protectors that have emerged in their</a><a name="ts_45847650_45855490_" > efforts to ensure survival. Once those protectors trust that it is safe to separate, the self will</a><a name="ts_45855490_45863500_" > spontaneously emerge, and the parts can be enlisted in the healing process. The second</a><a name="ts_45863500_45869630_" > assumption is that, rather than being a passive observer, this mindful self can help reorganize</a><a name="ts_45869630_45875690_" > the inner system and communicate with the parts in ways that help those parts trust that there is</a><a name="ts_45875690_45883456_" > someone inside who can handle things. Again, neuroscience research shows that this is not just a metaphor.</a><a name="ts_45883456_45884544_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_45884544_45890470_" > Mindfulness increases activation of the medial prefrontal cortex and decreases activation of structures</a><a name="ts_45890470_45896410_" > like the amygdala that trigger our emotional responses. This increases our control over the</a><a name="ts_45896410_45903520_" > emotional brain, even more than encouraging a relationship between a therapist and a helpless patient.</a><a name="ts_45904256_45909940_" > IFS focuses on cultivating an inner relationship between the self and the various protective parts.</a><a name="ts_45909940_45911392_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_45911392_45917530_" > In this model of treatment, the self doesn&#x27;t only witness or passively observe, as in some meditation</a><a name="ts_45917530_45926730_" > traditions. It has an active leadership role. The self is like an orchestra conductor who helps all the</a><a name="ts_45926730_45937030_" > parts to function harmoniously as a symphony rather than a cacophony, getting to know the internal</a><a name="ts_45937030_45945110_" > landscape. The task of the therapist is to help patients separate this confusing blend into separate</a><a name="ts_45945110_45952430_" > identities so that they are able to say, this part of me is like a little child, and that part of me is</a><a name="ts_45952430_45959700_" > more mature but feels like a victim. They might not like many of these parts, but identifying them makes them less</a><a name="ts_45959700_45966190_" > intimidating or overwhelming. The next step is to encourage patients to simply ask each protective</a><a name="ts_45966190_45976080_" > part as it emerges to stand back temporarily so that we can see what it is protecting. When this is done,</a><a name="ts_45976260_45983424_" > again and again, the parts begin to unblend from the self and make space for mindful self-observation.</a><a name="ts_45983424_45984768_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_45984768_45991136_" > Patients learn to put their fear, rage, or distrust on hold and open up into states of curiosity and self-reflection.</a><a name="ts_45991136_45992800_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_45992800_45999392_" > From the stable perspective of self, they can begin constructive inner dialogues with their parts.</a><a name="ts_45999392_46001792_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_46001792_46007650_" > Patients are asked to identify the part involved in the current problem, like feeling worthless,</a><a name="ts_46008290_46015680_" > abandoned, or obsessed with vengeful thoughts. As they ask themselves, what inside me feels that way?</a><a name="ts_46016480_46023584_" > An image may come to mind. Maybe the depressed part looks like an abandoned child, or an aging man,</a><a name="ts_46024192_46029880_" > or an overwhelmed nurse taking care of the wounded. A vengeful part might appear as a combat marine,</a><a name="ts_46029880_46038570_" > or a member of a street gang. Next, the therapist asks, how do you feel toward that sad, vengeful,</a><a name="ts_46038690_46045300_" > terrified part of you? This sets the stage for mindful self-observation by separating the you</a><a name="ts_46045300_46053640_" > from the part in question. If the patient has an extreme response like, I hate it, the therapist knows</a><a name="ts_46053640_46061130_" > that there is another protective part blended with self. He or she might then ask, see if the part that hates</a><a name="ts_46061130_46068670_" > it would step back. Then, the protective part is often thanked for its vigilance and assured that</a><a name="ts_46068670_46075710_" > it can return any time that it is needed. If the protective part is willing, the follow-up question</a><a name="ts_46075710_46082310_" > is, how do you feel toward the previously rejected part now? The patient is likely to say something</a><a name="ts_46082310_46091200_" > like, I wonder why it&#x27;s so sad or vengeful, etc. This sets the stage for getting to know the part better.</a><a name="ts_46092064_46100550_" > For example, by inquiring how odd it is and how it came to feel the way it does. Once a patient manifests</a><a name="ts_46100550_46107070_" > a critical mass of self, this kind of dialogue begins to take place spontaneously. At this point,</a><a name="ts_46107070_46112430_" > it&#x27;s important for the therapist to step aside and just keep an eye out for other parts that might</a><a name="ts_46112430_46118630_" > interfere or make occasional empathetic comments or ask questions like, what do you say to the part</a><a name="ts_46118630_46127490_" > about that? Or, where do you want to go now? Or, what feels like the right next step? As well as the</a><a name="ts_46127490_46138850_" > ubiquitous self-detecting question, how do you feel toward that part now? A life in parts. Joan came to see</a><a name="ts_46138850_46143970_" > me to help her manage her uncontrollable temper tantrums and to deal with her guilt about her numerous</a><a name="ts_46143970_46151510_" > affairs. Most recently, with her tennis coach. As she put it in our first session, I go from being</a><a name="ts_46151510_46158010_" > a kick-ass professional woman, to a whimpering child, to a furious bitch, to a pitiless eating</a><a name="ts_46158010_46165690_" > machine in the course of ten minutes. I have no idea which of these I really am. By this point in the</a><a name="ts_46165690_46172160_" > session, Joan had already critiqued the prints on my wall, my rickety furniture, and my messy desk.</a><a name="ts_46172160_46173344_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_46173344_46179680_" > Offense was her best defense.

She knew that for therapy to work, she&#x27;d have to make herself</a><a name="ts_46185590_46192190_" > vulnerable, so she had to find out if I could tolerate her anger, fear, and sorrow. I realized</a><a name="ts_46192190_46197470_" > that the only way to counter her defensiveness was by showing a high level of interest in the details</a><a name="ts_46197470_46203450_" > of her life, demonstrating unwavering support for the risks she took in talking with me, and accepting</a><a name="ts_46203450_46211110_" > the parts she was most ashamed of. I asked Joan if she had noticed the part of herself that was</a><a name="ts_46211110_46217024_" > critical. She acknowledged that she had, and I asked her how she felt toward that critic.</a><a name="ts_46217024_46218784_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_46218784_46223488_" > This key question allowed her to begin to separate from that part, and to access herself.</a><a name="ts_46223488_46224928_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_46224928_46228416_" > Joan responded that she hated the critic, because it reminded her of her mother.</a><a name="ts_46228416_46229824_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_46229824_46233536_" > When I asked her what that critical part might be protecting, her anger subsided,</a><a name="ts_46234336_46239690_" > and she became more curious and thoughtful.

But the affairs always ended in a similar way.</a><a name="ts_46288832_46293530_" > In the middle of a lovemaking session, she would suddenly become terrified and curl up into a ball,</a><a name="ts_46293990_46300580_" > whimpering like a little girl. These scenes left her confused and disgusted. And afterward,</a><a name="ts_46300760_46307770_" > she could not bear to have anything more to do with her lover. Like Marilyn in Chapter 8,</a><a name="ts_46308170_46312000_" > Joan told me that she had learned to make herself disappear when she was being molested,</a><a name="ts_46312768_46318340_" > floating above the scene as if it were happening to some other girl. Pushing the molestation out of her</a><a name="ts_46318340_46323500_" > mind had enabled Joan to have a normal school life of sleepovers, girlfriends, and team sports.</a><a name="ts_46323500_46329450_" > The trouble began in adolescence, when she developed her pattern of frigid contempt for</a><a name="ts_46329450_46337340_" > boys who treated her well, and having casual sex that left her humiliated and ashamed.

While specific memories of her abuse were split off,</a><a name="ts_46351270_46359250_" > dissociated, she unwittingly kept reenacting them. I did not try to explain to her why she felt so angry,</a><a name="ts_46359250_46365850_" > guilty, or shut down. She already thought of herself as damaged goods. In therapy, as in memory,</a><a name="ts_46365990_46374060_" > processing, pendulation, the gradual approach that I discovered in Chapter 13, is central. For Joan to be</a><a name="ts_46374060_46379104_" > able to deal with her misery and hurt, we would have to recruit her own strength and self-love,</a><a name="ts_46379872_46387904_" > enabling her to heal herself. This meant focusing on her many inner resources and reminding myself that</a><a name="ts_46388512_46393900_" > I could not provide her with the love and caring she had missed as a child.

Meeting the managers. As Joan&#x27;s treatment progressed,</a><a name="ts_46419008_46424440_" > we identified many different parts that were in charge at different times.

As usual, we met the managers first. Their job was to prevent</a><a name="ts_46442170_46449470_" > humiliation and abandonment and to keep her organized and safe.

However, after a negative evaluation at work,</a><a name="ts_46570272_46578208_" > Joan went into a tailspin, berating herself for not protecting herself, then feeling clingy, weak, and powerless.</a><a name="ts_46578208_46579936_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_46579936_46585344_" > When I asked her to see where that powerless part was located in her body and how she felt toward it,</a><a name="ts_46585952_46592600_" > she resisted. She told me she couldn&#x27;t stand that whiny, incompetent girl who made her feel embarrassed</a><a name="ts_46592600_46598880_" > and contemptuous of herself. I suspected that this part held much of the memory of her abuse,</a><a name="ts_46599744_46609780_" > and I decided not to pressure her at this point. She left my office withdrawn and upset. The next day,</a><a name="ts_46609780_46615670_" > she raided the refrigerator and then spent hours vomiting up her food. When she returned to my</a><a name="ts_46615670_46621050_" > office, she told me she wanted to kill herself, and was surprised that I seemed genuinely curious</a><a name="ts_46621050_46626944_" > and non-judgmental, and that I did not condemn her for either her bulimia or her suicidality. When I</a><a name="ts_46626944_46628704_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_46628704_46636560_" > asked her what parts were involved, the critic came back and blurted out, she is disgusting. When she asked</a><a name="ts_46636560_46643400_" > that part to step back, the next part said, nobody will ever love me, followed again by the critic,</a><a name="ts_46643400_46649130_" > who told me that the best way to help her would be to ignore all that noise and to increase</a><a name="ts_46649130_46655590_" > her medications. Clearly, in their desire to protect her injured parts, these managers were</a><a name="ts_46655590_46661610_" > unintentionally doing her harm. So I kept asking them what they thought would happen if they stepped</a><a name="ts_46661610_46670210_" > back. Joan answered, people will hate me, and I will be all alone and out in the street. This was</a><a name="ts_46670210_46676330_" > followed by a memory. Her mother had told her that if she disobeyed, she would be put up for adoption and</a><a name="ts_46676330_46683420_" > never see her sisters or her dog again. When I asked her how she felt about that scared girl</a><a name="ts_46683420_46691610_" > inside, she cried and said that she felt bad for her. Now herself was back, and I was confident</a><a name="ts_46691610_46702430_" > that we had calmed the system down. But this session turned out to be too much too soon. Putting out the</a><a name="ts_46702430_46709130_" > flames. The following week, Joan missed her appointment. We had triggered her exiles, and her</a><a name="ts_46709130_46715710_" > firefighters went on a rampage. As she told me later, the evening after we talked about her terror of being</a><a name="ts_46715710_46721850_" > put into foster care, she felt as if she were going to blast out of herself. She went to a bar</a><a name="ts_46721850_46728690_" > and picked up a guy. Coming home late, drunk and disheveled, she refused to talk to her husband and</a><a name="ts_46728690_46736490_" > fell asleep in the den. The next morning, she acted as if nothing had happened. Firefighters will do</a><a name="ts_46736490_46742272_" > anything to make emotional pain go away. Aside from sharing the task of keeping the exiles locked up,</a><a name="ts_46742976_46749470_" > they are the opposite of managers. Managers are all about staying in control, while firefighters</a><a name="ts_46749470_46756420_" > will destroy the house in order to extinguish the fire. The struggle between uptight managers</a><a name="ts_46756420_46762240_" > and out-of-control firefighters will continue until the exiles, which carry the burden of the trauma,</a><a name="ts_46762944_46769650_" > are allowed to come home and be cared for. Anyone who deals with survivors will encounter those</a><a name="ts_46769650_46777590_" > firefighters. I&#x27;ve met firefighters who shop, drink, play computer games addictively, have impulsive affairs,</a><a name="ts_46777830_46784384_" > or exercise compulsively. A sordid encounter can blunt the abused child&#x27;s horror and shame,</a><a name="ts_46785088_46791010_" > if only for a couple of hours. It is critical to remember that, at their core,</a><a name="ts_46791710_46797410_" > firefighters are also desperately trying to protect the system. Unlike managers, who are usually</a><a name="ts_46797410_46803450_" > superficially cooperative during therapy, firefighters don&#x27;t hold back. They hurl insults</a><a name="ts_46803450_46808750_" > and storm out of the room. Firefighters are frantic, and if you ask them what would happen if they</a><a name="ts_46808750_46813710_" > stopped doing their job, you discover that they believe the exiled feelings would crash the entire</a><a name="ts_46813710_46819810_" > self-system. They are also oblivious to the idea that there are better ways to guarantee physical and</a><a name="ts_46819810_46827010_" > emotional safety. And even if behaviors like binging or cutting stop, firefighters often</a><a name="ts_46827010_46833570_" > find other methods of self-harm. These cycles will come to an end only when the self is able to take</a><a name="ts_46833570_46845410_" > charge and the system feels safe. The burden of toxicity. Exiles are the toxic waste dump of the</a><a name="ts_46845410_46852768_" > system. Because they hold the memories, sensations, beliefs, and emotions associated with trauma,</a><a name="ts_46853696_46861390_" > it&#x27;s hazardous to release them. They contain the, oh my god, I&#x27;m done for, experience. The essence of</a><a name="ts_46861390_46870050_" > inescapable shock. And with it, terror, collapse, and accommodation. Exiles may reveal themselves in the</a><a name="ts_46870050_46875630_" > form of crushing physical sensations or extreme numbing, and they offend both the reasonableness of</a><a name="ts_46875630_46884320_" > the managers and the bravado of the firefighters. Like most incest survivors, Joan hated her exiles.</a><a name="ts_46884928_46889940_" > particularly the little girl who had responded to her abuser&#x27;s sexual demands, and the terrified</a><a name="ts_46889940_46896672_" > child who whimpered alone in her bed. When exiles overwhelm managers, they take us over. We are</a><a name="ts_46897408_46904950_" > nothing but that rejected, weak, unloved, and abandoned child. The self becomes blended with the exiles, and</a><a name="ts_46904950_46911790_" > every possible alternative for our life is eclipsed. Then, as Schwartz points out, we see ourselves and the</a><a name="ts_46911790_46917870_" > world through their eyes and believe it is the world. In this state, it won&#x27;t occur to us that we have been</a><a name="ts_46917870_46925920_" > hijacked. Keeping the exiles locked up, however, stamps out not only memories and emotions, but also</a><a name="ts_46925920_46933088_" > the parts that hold them. The parts that were hurt the most by the trauma. In Schwartz&#x27;s words,</a><a name="ts_46933696_46939680_" > usually those are your most sensitive, creative, intimacy-loving, lively, playful, and innocent parts.</a><a name="ts_46940544_46945510_" > By exiling them when they get hurt, they suffer a double whammy. The insult of your rejection</a><a name="ts_46945510_46953696_" > is added to their original injury. As Joan discovered, keeping the exiles hidden and despised</a><a name="ts_46954336_46963616_" > was condemning her to a life without intimacy or genuine joy. Unlocking the past.</a><a name="ts_46963616_46965440_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_46965440_46969940_" > Several months into Joan&#x27;s treatment, we again accessed the exiled girl who carried the humiliation,</a><a name="ts_46970280_46976160_" > confusion, and shame of Joan&#x27;s molestation. By then, she had come to trust me enough and had</a><a name="ts_46976160_46982560_" > developed enough sense of self to be able to tolerate observing herself as a child, with all her long-buried</a><a name="ts_46982560_46989710_" > feelings of terror, excitement, surrender, and complicity. She did not say very much during this process,</a><a name="ts_46989710_46995880_" > and my main job was to keep her in a state of calm self-observation. She often had the impulse</a><a name="ts_46995880_47003200_" > to pull away in disgust and horror, leaving this unacceptable child alone in her misery. At these</a><a name="ts_47003200_47009210_" > points, I asked her protectors to step back so that she could keep listening to what her little girl</a><a name="ts_47009210_47016130_" > wanted her to know. Finally, with my encouragement, she was able to rush into the scene and take the</a><a name="ts_47016130_47022290_" > girl away with her to a safe place. She firmly told her abuser that she would never let him get close</a><a name="ts_47022290_47028416_" > to her again. Instead of denying the child, she played an active role in liberating her.</a><a name="ts_47028416_47030336_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47030336_47036100_" > As in EMDR, the resolution of the trauma was the result of her ability to access her imagination</a><a name="ts_47036100_47042760_" > and rework the scenes in which she had become frozen so long ago. Helpless passivity was replaced</a><a name="ts_47042760_47050060_" > by determined, self-led action. Once Joan started to own her impulses and behaviors,</a><a name="ts_47050340_47056160_" > she recognized the emptiness of her relationship with her husband, Brian, and began to insist on change.</a><a name="ts_47057120_47062020_" > I invited her to ask Brian to meet with us, and she was present for eight sessions before he</a><a name="ts_47062020_47069870_" > began to see me individually. Schwartz observes that IFS can help family members mentor each other</a><a name="ts_47069870_47076810_" > as they learn to observe how one person&#x27;s parts interact with another&#x27;s. I witnessed this firsthand</a><a name="ts_47076810_47082912_" > with Joan and Brian. Brian was initially quite proud of having put up with Joan&#x27;s behavior for so long.</a><a name="ts_47083552_47089320_" > Feeling that she really needed him had kept him from even considering divorce. But now that she</a><a name="ts_47089320_47095340_" > wanted more intimacy, he felt pressured and inadequate, revealing a panicked part that</a><a name="ts_47095340_47102870_" > blanked out and put up a wall against feeling. Gradually, Brian began to talk about growing up in an</a><a name="ts_47102870_47109370_" > alcoholic family where behaviors like Joan&#x27;s were common and largely ignored, punctuated by his father&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_47109370_47115424_" > stays in detox centers and his mother&#x27;s long hospitalizations for depression and suicide attempts.</a><a name="ts_47115424_47117344_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47117344_47121792_" > When I asked his panicked part what would happen if it allowed Brian to feel anything,</a><a name="ts_47122624_47128120_" > He revealed his fear of being overwhelmed by pain. The pain of his childhood added to the pain</a><a name="ts_47128120_47135690_" > of his relationship with Joan. Over the next few weeks, other parts emerged. First came a protector</a><a name="ts_47135690_47140690_" > that was frightened of women and determined never to let Brian become vulnerable to their manipulations.</a><a name="ts_47140690_47142496_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47142496_47147840_" > Then we discovered a strong caretaker part that had looked after his mother and his younger siblings.</a><a name="ts_47147840_47149152_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_47149152_47154048_" > This part gave Brian a feeling of self-worth and purpose and a way of dealing with his own terror.</a><a name="ts_47154048_47155840_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47155840_47162600_" > Finally, Brian was ready to meet his exile, the scared, essentially motherless child who had no one</a><a name="ts_47162600_47173100_" > to care for him. This is a very short version of a long exploration, which involved many diversions,</a><a name="ts_47173440_47180250_" > as when Joan&#x27;s critic reemerged from time to time. But from the beginning, IFS helped Joan and Brian</a><a name="ts_47180250_47185930_" > hear themselves and each other from the perspective of an objective, curious, and compassionate self.</a><a name="ts_47185930_47193088_" > They were no longer locked in the past, and a whole range of new possibilities opened up for them.</a><a name="ts_47193088_47198144_" > (.....)</a><a name="ts_47198144_47202740_" > The power of self-compassion, IFS, and the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.</a><a name="ts_47202740_47205664_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_47205664_47210624_" > Nancy Shattuck is a rheumatologist at Boston&#x27;s Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital,</a><a name="ts_47211360_47217310_" > who combines medical research on rheumatoid arthritis, known as RA, with a strong interest in</a><a name="ts_47217310_47224160_" > her patients&#x27; personal experience of their illness. When she discovered IFS at a workshop with Richard Schwartz,</a><a name="ts_47224832_47230784_" > she decided to incorporate the therapy into a study of psychosocial intervention with RA patients.</a><a name="ts_47230784_47232512_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47232512_47237060_" > RA is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammatory disorders throughout the body,</a><a name="ts_47237260_47243680_" > causing chronic pain and disability.

I followed this study with particular interest because of the link</a><a name="ts_47256950_47263870_" > I&#x27;d observed between trauma and autoimmune disease. Working with senior IFS therapist Nancy</a><a name="ts_47263870_47270010_" > Sowell, Dr. Shattuck created a nine-month randomized study in which one group of RA patients would receive</a><a name="ts_47270010_47276930_" > both group and individual instruction in IFS, while a control group received regular mailings and phone</a><a name="ts_47276930_47282730_" > calls regarding disease symptoms and management.

They would</a><a name="ts_47302450_47307870_" > learn the inner dialogue skills that would enable them to recognize their pain, identify the accompanying</a><a name="ts_47307870_47315960_" > thoughts and emotions, and then approach these internal states with interest and compassion. A basic</a><a name="ts_47315960_47323350_" > problem emerged early. Like so many trauma survivors, the RA patients were alexithymic. As Nancy</a><a name="ts_47323350_47329410_" > Sowell later told me, they never complained about their pain or disability unless they were totally</a><a name="ts_47329410_47337290_" > overwhelmed. Asked how they were feeling, they almost always replied, I&#x27;m fine. Their stoic parts clearly</a><a name="ts_47337290_47343490_" > helped them cope, but these managers also kept them in a state of denial. Some shut out their bodily</a><a name="ts_47343490_47348530_" > sensations and emotions to the extent that they could not collaborate effectively with their doctors.</a><a name="ts_47348530_47350784_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47350784_47357370_" > To get things moving, the leaders introduced the IFS parts dramatically, rearranging furniture and props</a><a name="ts_47357370_47365250_" > to represent managers, exiles, and firefighters.

The two groups, IFS and controls, were evaluated three times during the</a><a name="ts_47432170_47436810_" > nine-month study period, and then again one year later. At the end of nine months,</a><a name="ts_47436970_47442110_" > the IFS group showed measurable improvements in self-assessed joint pain, physical function,</a><a name="ts_47442590_47448960_" > self-compassion, and overall pain relative to the education group. They also showed significant</a><a name="ts_47448960_47456230_" > improvements in depression and self-efficacy. The IFS group&#x27;s gains in pain perception and depressive</a><a name="ts_47456230_47462230_" > symptoms were sustained one year later, although objective medical tests could no longer detect</a><a name="ts_47462230_47468850_" > measurable improvements in pain or function. In other words, what had changed most was the</a><a name="ts_47468850_47475490_" > patient&#x27;s ability to live with their disease. In their conclusions, Shattuck and Soule emphasized IFS&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_47475490_47483480_" > focus on self-compassion as a key factor. This was not the first study to show that psychological</a><a name="ts_47483480_47490530_" > interventions can help RA patients.

As he sat in my office in perfect physical</a><a name="ts_47529480_47536640_" > shape because of his regular squash practice, his confidence had crossed the line into arrogance. This man</a><a name="ts_47536640_47542550_" > certainly did not seem to suffer from PTSD.

Peter also told me that his psychiatry rotation in med school</a><a name="ts_47599670_47606040_" > had convinced him that psychiatrists still practiced witchcraft, and his one stint in couples therapy</a><a name="ts_47606040_47611410_" > had further confirmed that opinion.

But Peter denied that this bothered him. He went to school and got</a><a name="ts_47668450_47673840_" > straight A&#x27;s. He had vowed to build a life free of rejection and humiliation. But, ironically,</a><a name="ts_47673840_47674912_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_47674912_47680650_" > he lived with death and rejection every day, death on the oncology ward, and the constant struggle to</a><a name="ts_47680650_47688930_" > get his research funded and published. Peter&#x27;s wife joined us for the next meeting. She described how</a><a name="ts_47688930_47695600_" > he criticized her incessantly, her taste in clothes, her child-wearing practices, her reading habits,</a><a name="ts_47695740_47702560_" > her intelligence, her friends. He was rarely at home and never emotionally available. Because he had so</a><a name="ts_47702560_47709152_" > many important obligations and because he was so explosive, his family always tiptoed around him.</a><a name="ts_47709152_47710560_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_47710560_47715930_" > She was determined to leave him and start a new life unless he made some radical changes. At that</a><a name="ts_47715930_47723264_" > point, for the first time, I saw Peter become obviously distressed. He assured me and his wife that he</a><a name="ts_47723808_47731980_" > wanted to work things out. At our next session, I asked him to let his body relax, close his eyes,</a><a name="ts_47732380_47740230_" > focus his attention inside, and ask that critical part, the one his wife had identified, what it was afraid</a><a name="ts_47740230_47747730_" > would happen if he stopped his ruthless judging. After about 30 seconds, he said he felt stupid</a><a name="ts_47747730_47754770_" > talking to himself. He didn&#x27;t want to try some new age gimmick. He&#x27;d come to me looking for empirically</a><a name="ts_47754770_47762220_" > verified therapy. I assured him that, like him, I was at the forefront of empirically based therapies,</a><a name="ts_47763008_47767936_" > and that this was one of them. He was silent for perhaps a minute before he whispered,</a><a name="ts_47767936_47768992_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_47768992_47776210_" > I would get hurt. I urged him to ask the critic what that meant. Still with his eyes closed,</a><a name="ts_47776330_47784360_" > Peter replied, if you criticize others, they don&#x27;t dare to hurt you. Then, if you are perfect,</a><a name="ts_47784360_47791090_" > nobody can criticize you. I asked him to thank his critic for protecting him against hurt and</a><a name="ts_47791090_47796720_" > humiliation. And as he became silent again, I could see his shoulders relax and his breathing</a><a name="ts_47796720_47804150_" > become slower and deeper. He next told me that he was aware that his pomposity was affecting his</a><a name="ts_47804150_47810720_" > relationships with his colleagues and students. He felt lonely and despised during staff meetings and</a><a name="ts_47811264_47817630_" > uncomfortable at hospital parties. When I asked him if he wanted to change the way that angry part</a><a name="ts_47817630_47824040_" > threatened people, he replied that he did. I then asked him where it was located in his body,</a><a name="ts_47824040_47829460_" > and he found it in the middle of his chest. Keeping his focus inside, I asked him how he</a><a name="ts_47829460_47836416_" > felt toward it. He said it made him scared. Next, I asked him to stay focused on it and</a><a name="ts_47837184_47844290_" > see how he felt toward it now. He said he was curious to know more about it. I asked him how old</a><a name="ts_47844290_47851552_" > it was. He said about seven. I asked him to have his critic show him what he protected.</a><a name="ts_47851552_47853120_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_47853120_47858070_" > After a lengthy silence, still with his eyes closed, he told me that he was witnessing a scene from his</a><a name="ts_47858070_47865070_" > childhood. His father was beating a little boy, him, and he was standing to one side thinking how stupid that</a><a name="ts_47865070_47871104_" > kid was to provoke his dad. When I asked him how he felt about the boy who was getting hurt,</a><a name="ts_47871872_47879200_" > he told me that he despised him. He was a weakling and a whiner. After showing even the least bit of</a><a name="ts_47879200_47885560_" > defiance to his dad&#x27;s high-handed ways, he inevitably capitulated and whimpered that he would be a good</a><a name="ts_47885560_47893570_" > little boy. He had no guts, no fire in his belly. I asked the critic if he would be willing to step aside</a><a name="ts_47893570_47900700_" > so he could see what was going on with that boy. In response, the critic appeared in full force and called</a><a name="ts_47900700_47906950_" > him names like Wimp and Sissy. I asked Peter again if the critic would be willing to step aside</a><a name="ts_47906950_47913350_" > and give the boy a chance to speak. He shut down completely and left the session saying that he was</a><a name="ts_47913850_47921670_" > unlikely ever to set foot in my office again. But the following week he was back. As she had threatened,</a><a name="ts_47922130_47929350_" > his wife had gone to a lawyer and filed for divorce. He was devastated and no longer looked anything like</a><a name="ts_47929350_47936210_" > the perfectly put together doctor who might come to know and in many ways dread. Faced with the loss of his</a><a name="ts_47936210_47942016_" > family, he became unhinged and felt comforted by the idea that if things got too bad, he could</a><a name="ts_47942880_47948690_" > take his life in his own hands. We went inside again and identified the part that was terrified</a><a name="ts_47948690_47955270_" > of abandonment. Once he was in mindful self-state, I urged him to ask that terrified boy to show him</a><a name="ts_47955270_47962010_" > the burdens he was carrying. Again, his first reaction was disgust at the boy&#x27;s weakness. But after I</a><a name="ts_47962010_47966930_" > asked him to get that part to step back, he saw an image of himself as a young boy in his parents&#x27; house,</a><a name="ts_47966930_47973536_" > alone in his room, screaming in terror. Peter watched this scene for several minutes,</a><a name="ts_47974112_47979420_" > weeping silently through most of it. I asked him if the boy had told him everything he wanted him to</a><a name="ts_47979420_47986790_" > know. No, there were other scenes, like running to embrace his father at the door and getting slapped</a><a name="ts_47986790_47993530_" > for having disobeyed his mother. From time to time he would interrupt the process by explaining why his</a><a name="ts_47993530_47999328_" > parents couldn&#x27;t have done any better than they had, there being Holocaust survivors and all that implied.</a><a name="ts_47999328_48000736_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_48000736_48005536_" > Again, I suggested he find the protective parts that were interrupting the witnessing of the boy&#x27;s pain</a><a name="ts_48006368_48012830_" > and request that they move temporarily to another room. And each time he was able to return to his</a><a name="ts_48012830_48021920_" > grief. I asked Peter to tell the boy that he now understood how bad the experience had been. He sat in</a><a name="ts_48021920_48030190_" > a long, sad silence. Then I asked him to show the boy that he cared about him. After some coaxing,</a><a name="ts_48030976_48037960_" > he put his arms around the boy. I was surprised that this seemingly harsh and callous man knew exactly how to</a><a name="ts_48037960_48045184_" > take care of him. Then after some time, I urged Peter to go back into the scene and take the boy away with him.</a><a name="ts_48045184_48046560_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_48046560_48049910_" > Peter imagined himself confronting his dad as a grown man, telling him,</a><a name="ts_48050784_48056640_" > if you ever mess with that boy again, I&#x27;ll come and kill you. He then, in his imagination,</a><a name="ts_48057408_48063168_" > took the child to a beautiful campground, he knew, where the boy could play and frolic with ponies</a><a name="ts_48063744_48071870_" > while he watched over him. Our work was not done. After his wife rescinded her threat of divorce,</a><a name="ts_48072170_48077870_" > some of his old habits returned and we had to revisit that isolated boy from time to time to make sure that</a><a name="ts_48077870_48083070_" > Peter&#x27;s wounded parts were taken care of, especially when he felt hurt by something that had happened at</a><a name="ts_48083070_48091750_" > home or on the job. This is the stage IFS calls unburdening, and it corresponds to nursing those</a><a name="ts_48091750_48098010_" > exiled parts back to health. With each new unburdening, Peter&#x27;s once scathing inner critic relaxed.</a><a name="ts_48098230_48103410_" > As little by little, it became more like a mentor than a judge, and he began to repair his relationships</a><a name="ts_48103410_48110390_" > with his family and colleagues. He also stopped suffering from tension headaches. One day,</a><a name="ts_48110390_48115800_" > he told me that he&#x27;d spent his adulthood trying to let go of his past, and he remarked how ironic</a><a name="ts_48115800_48129640_" > it was that he had to get closer to it in order to let it go.

It was clear that their lives would change fundamentally only if they could reconstruct</a><a name="ts_48245560_48253760_" > those implicit maps. But how? How can we help people become viscerally acquainted with feelings that were</a><a name="ts_48254304_48261820_" > lacking early in their lives? I glimpsed a possible answer when I attended the founding conference of</a><a name="ts_48261820_48268544_" > the United States Association for Body Psychotherapy in June 1994 at a small college in Beverly,</a><a name="ts_48269184_48275480_" > on the rocky Massachusetts coast. Ironically, I had been asked to represent mainstream psychiatry at</a><a name="ts_48275480_48281530_" > the meeting and to speak on using brain scans to visualize mental states. But as soon as I walked</a><a name="ts_48281530_48286880_" > into the lobby where attendees had gathered for morning coffee, I realized that this was a different</a><a name="ts_48286880_48294150_" > crowd from my usual psychopharmacological or psychotherapy gatherings. The way they talked to one</a><a name="ts_48294150_48300830_" > another, their postures and gestures, radiated vitality and engagement, the sort of physical</a><a name="ts_48300830_48307100_" > reciprocity that is the essence of attunement. I soon struck up a conversation with Albert Pesso,</a><a name="ts_48307420_48312160_" > a stocky former dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company, who was then in his early 70s.</a><a name="ts_48312160_48313760_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_48313760_48319400_" > Underneath his bushy eyebrows, he exuded kindness and confidence.

His enthusiasm was</a><a name="ts_48326960_48332860_" > infectious. But I was skeptical and asked him if he was certain he could change the settings of the</a><a name="ts_48332860_48338070_" > amygdala. Unfazed by the fact that nobody had ever tested his method scientifically,</a><a name="ts_48338070_48339136_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_48339136_48346810_" > he confidently assured me that he could. Pesso was about to conduct a workshop in PBSP psychomotor</a><a name="ts_48346810_48354930_" > therapy, and he invited me to attend. It was unlike any group work I had ever seen. He took a low chair</a><a name="ts_48354930_48360570_" > opposite a woman named Nancy, whom he called a protagonist, with the other participants seated on</a><a name="ts_48360570_48367250_" > pillows around them. He then invited Nancy to talk about what was troubling her, occasionally using her</a><a name="ts_48367250_48374230_" > pauses to witness what he was observing, as in, a witness can see how crestfallen you are when you</a><a name="ts_48374230_48380290_" > talk about your father deserting the family. I was impressed by how carefully he tracked subtle shifts</a><a name="ts_48380290_48386848_" > in body posture, facial expression, tone of voice, and eye gaze, the nonverbal expressions of emotion.</a><a name="ts_48386848_48388384_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_48388384_48396870_" > This is called micro-tracking in psychomotor therapy. Each time Pesso made a witness statement,</a><a name="ts_48397430_48403340_" > Nancy&#x27;s face and body relaxed a bit, as if she felt comforted by being seen and validated.</a><a name="ts_48403340_48411790_" > His quiet comments seemed to bolster her courage to continue to go deeper. When Nancy started to cry,</a><a name="ts_48412070_48417370_" > he observed that nobody should have to bear so much pain all by herself, and he asked if she would</a><a name="ts_48417370_48424410_" > like to choose someone to sit next to her. He called this a contact person. Nancy nodded, and after</a><a name="ts_48424410_48430580_" > carefully scanning the room, pointed to a kind-looking middle-aged woman. Pesso asked Nancy where she would</a><a name="ts_48430580_48438112_" > like her contact person to sit. Right here, Nancy said decisively, indicating a pillow immediately to her right.</a><a name="ts_48438112_48440096_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_48440096_48445360_" > I was fascinated. People process spatial relations with the right hemisphere of the brain,</a><a name="ts_48445460_48450160_" > and our neuroimaging research had shown that the imprint of trauma is principally on the right</a><a name="ts_48450160_48458320_" > hemisphere as well. Caring, disapproval, and indifference are all primarily conveyed by facial expression,</a><a name="ts_48458740_48465110_" > tone of voice, and physical movements. According to recent research, up to 90 percent of human</a><a name="ts_48465110_48471030_" > communication occurs occurs in the nonverbal right hemisphere realm, and this is where Pesso&#x27;s work</a><a name="ts_48471030_48478990_" > seemed primarily to be directed. As the workshop went on, I was also struck by how the contact person&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_48478990_48486310_" > presence seemed to help Nancy tolerate the painful experiences she was dredging up. But what was most</a><a name="ts_48486310_48494770_" > unusual was how Pesso created tableaus, or as he called them, structures, of the protagonist&#x27;s past. As the</a><a name="ts_48494770_48499370_" > narratives unfolded, group participants were asked to play the roles of significant people in the</a><a name="ts_48499370_48505210_" > protagonists&#x27; lives, such as parents and other family members, so that their inner world began to</a><a name="ts_48505210_48511180_" > take form in three-dimensional space. Group members were also enlisted to play the ideal,</a><a name="ts_48511520_48516900_" > wished-for parents who would provide the support, love, and protection that had been lacking at critical</a><a name="ts_48516900_48524768_" > moments. Protagonists became the directors of their own plays, creating around them the past they never had.</a><a name="ts_48524768_48525856_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_48525856_48530520_" > And they clearly experienced profound physical and mental relief after these imaginary scenarios.</a><a name="ts_48530520_48532256_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_48532256_48536830_" > Could this technique instill imprints of safety and comfort alongside those of terror and abandonment,</a><a name="ts_48537270_48544870_" > decades after the original shaping of mind and brain? Intrigued with the promise of Pesso&#x27;s work,</a><a name="ts_48544970_48552000_" > I eagerly accepted his invitation to visit his hilltop farmhouse in southern New Hampshire. After lunch</a><a name="ts_48552000_48559540_" > beneath an ancient oak tree, Al asked me to join him in his red-clabbered barn, now a studio, to do a</a><a name="ts_48559540_48567960_" > structure. I&#x27;d spent several years in psychoanalysis, so I did not expect any major revelations. I was a</a><a name="ts_48567960_48573480_" > settled, professional man in my 40s with my own family, and I thought of my parents as two elderly</a><a name="ts_48573480_48579160_" > people who were trying to create a decent old age for themselves. I certainly did not think they still</a><a name="ts_48579160_48587090_" > had a major influence on me. Since there were no other people available for role-play, Al began by asking</a><a name="ts_48587090_48593660_" > me to select an object or a piece of furniture to represent my father. I chose a gigantic black leather</a><a name="ts_48593660_48602090_" > couch and asked Al to put it upright, about eight feet in front of me, slightly to my left. Then he</a><a name="ts_48602090_48607490_" > asked if I&#x27;d like to bring my mother into the room as well, and I chose a heavy lamp, approximately the</a><a name="ts_48607490_48613050_" > same height as the upright couch. As the session continued, the space became populated with the</a><a name="ts_48613050_48620840_" > important people in my life. My best friend, a tiny Kleenex box to my right, my wife, a small pillow next to</a><a name="ts_48620840_48628580_" > him, my two children, two more tiny pillows. After a while, I surveyed the projection of my internal</a><a name="ts_48628580_48635540_" > landscape, two hulking, dark, and threatening objects, representing my parents, and an array</a><a name="ts_48635540_48644060_" > of minuscule objects, representing my wife, children, and friends.

Note that this work is not about improvisation, but about accurately enacting the</a><a name="ts_49114450_49122500_" > dialogue and directions provided by the witness and protagonist.

I encouraged Maria to take a good long look at her real father, and as she gazed at him</a><a name="ts_49178540_49186030_" > standing there, we could witness how her emotions shifted from terror to a deep sense of compassion for</a><a name="ts_49186030_49192890_" > him. She tearfully reflected on how difficult his life had been, how as a child during World War II,</a><a name="ts_49192890_49199424_" > he had seen people beheaded, how he had been forced to eat rotten fish infested with maggots.</a><a name="ts_49199424_49201280_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_49201280_49204928_" > Structures promote one of the essential conditions for deep therapeutic change,</a><a name="ts_49205568_49211680_" > a trance-like state in which multiple realities can live side by side, past and present.

As Maria began to speak about their relationship</a><a name="ts_49237150_49243830_" > when she was a little girl, I continued to mirror her expressions. Her father had brutalized her mother,</a><a name="ts_49243970_49251250_" > she said. He was relentlessly critical of her diet, her body, her housekeeping, and she was always afraid</a><a name="ts_49251250_49258850_" > for her mother when he berated her. Maria described her mother as loving and warm. She could not have</a><a name="ts_49258850_49264512_" > survived without her. She would always be there to comfort Maria after her father lashed out at her,</a><a name="ts_49265408_49270910_" > but she didn&#x27;t do anything to protect her children from her father&#x27;s rage. I think my mom had a lot</a><a name="ts_49270910_49278320_" > of fear herself. I have a sense that she didn&#x27;t protect us because she felt trapped. At this point,</a><a name="ts_49278400_49285220_" > I suggested that it was time to call Maria&#x27;s real mother into the room. Maria scanned the group and smiled</a><a name="ts_49285220_49291904_" > brightly as she asked Kristen, a blonde, Scandinavian-looking artist, to play the role of her real mother.</a><a name="ts_49291904_49293568_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_49293568_49295840_" > Kristen accepted in the formal words of the structure,</a><a name="ts_49295840_49306688_" > (11 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_49306688_49313360_" > Maria had her sit on a pillow to her right, much closer than her real father. I encouraged</a><a name="ts_49313360_49319370_" > Maria to look at Kristen and then asked, so what happens when you look at her? Maria angrily said,</a><a name="ts_49319890_49326230_" > nothing. A witness would see how you stiffen as you look at your real mom and angrily say that you</a><a name="ts_49326230_49337420_" > feel nothing, I noted. After a long silence, I asked again, so what happens now? Maria looked slightly more</a><a name="ts_49337420_49344320_" > collapsed and repeated, nothing. I asked her, is there something you want to say to your mom?</a><a name="ts_49344320_49345568_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_49345568_49352410_" > Finally, Maria said, I know you did the best you could, and then moments later, I wanted you to</a><a name="ts_49352410_49361350_" > protect me. When she began to cry softly, I asked her, what is happening inside? Holding my chest,</a><a name="ts_49361490_49367808_" > my heart feels like it is pounding really hard, Maria said. My sadness goes out to my mom,</a><a name="ts_49368480_49374180_" > how incapable she was of standing up to my father and protecting us. She just shuts down,</a><a name="ts_49374960_49379776_" > pretending everything&#x27;s okay, and in her mind it probably is, and that makes me mad today. I want</a><a name="ts_49380736_49386624_" > to say to her, mom, when I see you react to dad when he is being mean, when I see your face,</a><a name="ts_49387264_49393152_" > you look disgusted, and I don&#x27;t know why you don&#x27;t say, fuck off.

Nothing you do is right, like you accept everything when it is</a><a name="ts_49407300_49414430_" > totally not okay. I noted, a witness would see how fierce you are as you want your mother to</a><a name="ts_49414430_49420710_" > stand up to your dad. Maria then talked about how she wanted her mother to run off with the kids and</a><a name="ts_49420710_49426560_" > take them away from her terrifying father. I then suggested enrolling another group member to represent</a><a name="ts_49426560_49433120_" > her ideal mother. Maria scanned the room again and chose Ellen, a therapist and martial artist. Maria</a><a name="ts_49433120_49434400_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_49434400_49440660_" > placed her on a pillow to her right, between her real mother and herself, and asked Ellen to put her arm</a><a name="ts_49440660_49448352_" > around her. What do you want your ideal mother to say to your dad? I asked. I want her to say,</a><a name="ts_49449280_49453568_" > if you are going to talk like that, I am going to leave you and take the kids, she answered.

I have a subtle</a><a name="ts_49473270_49480130_" > energetic dance in my body now. Sweet. A witness can see how delighted you are when you hear your</a><a name="ts_49480130_49485040_" > mother saying that she&#x27;s not taking this shit from your dad anymore, and that she will take you away from</a><a name="ts_49485040_49492460_" > him. I told her. Maria began to sob and said, I would have been able to be a safe, happy little</a><a name="ts_49492460_49498912_" > girl. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see several group members weeping silently. The</a><a name="ts_49498912_49500032_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_49500032_49507050_" > possibility of growing up safe and happy clearly resonated with their own longings. After a while,</a><a name="ts_49507050_49512690_" > I suggested that it was time to summon Maria&#x27;s ideal father. I could clearly see the delight in</a><a name="ts_49512690_49520190_" > Maria&#x27;s eyes as she scanned the group, imagining her ideal father. She finally chose Danny. I gave him</a><a name="ts_49520190_49525930_" > his script and he gently told her, I enroll as your ideal father, who would have loved you and cared</a><a name="ts_49525930_49532550_" > for you and would not have terrified you. Maria instructed him to take a seat near her on her</a><a name="ts_49532550_49541220_" > left and beamed. My healthy mom and dad, she exclaimed. I responded, allow yourself to feel</a><a name="ts_49541220_49547712_" > that joy as you look at an ideal dad who would have cared for you. Maria cried, it&#x27;s beautiful,</a><a name="ts_49548256_49554390_" > and threw her arms around Danny, smiling at him through her tears. I am remembering a really tender</a><a name="ts_49554390_49560864_" > moment with my dad, and that is what this feels like.

I was quite worried about what would be revealed once</a><a name="ts_50020340_50026820_" > we started to look behind his frozen, expressionless exterior. When I invited Mark to talk about his</a><a name="ts_50026820_50033030_" > family, he said a few words and then seemed to shut down even more.

He chose a white-haired group member, Richard, and placed Richard on a</a><a name="ts_50039830_50046650_" > pillow next to him, touching his shoulder. Then, as he began to tell his story, Mark placed Joe,</a><a name="ts_50046650_50052736_" > as his real father, ten feet in front of him, and directed Carolyn, representing his mother,</a><a name="ts_50053440_50060010_" > to crouch in a corner with her face hidden.

I said,</a><a name="ts_50079744_50085130_" > A witness can see how startled you are, seeing what you had to deal with.

Then, looking at his</a><a name="ts_50090860_50100310_" > father, he burst out, You asshole! You hypocrite! You ruined my life! I invited Mark to tell his</a><a name="ts_50100310_50106496_" > father all the things that he wanted to tell him but never could.

After Mark had confronted his father, I asked if he would</a><a name="ts_50132840_50140180_" > like Richard to assume a new role, that of his ideal father. I instructed Richard to look Mark directly in</a><a name="ts_50140180_50145888_" > the eye and say, If I had been your ideal father back then, I would have listened to you and not</a><a name="ts_50146560_50152224_" > accused you of having a filthy imagination.

Mark visibly relaxed and said, That would have made all the difference in the world. Then,</a><a name="ts_50179264_50184750_" > Mark addressed the stand-in for his aunt. The group was visibly stunned as he unleashed a torrent</a><a name="ts_50184750_50192736_" > of abuse on her. You conniving whore. You backstabber. You betrayed your sister and ruined her life.</a><a name="ts_50193312_50200980_" > You ruined our family. After he was done, Mark started to sob. He then said he&#x27;d always been deeply</a><a name="ts_50200980_50206740_" > suspicious of any woman who showed an interest in him. The remainder of the structure took another half</a><a name="ts_50206740_50213100_" > hour, in which we slowly set up conditions for him to create two new women.

And she</a><a name="ts_50878624_50884760_" > told me that she&#x27;d been using neurofeedback in her private practice for about 10 years. She showed me</a><a name="ts_50884760_50890390_" > before and after drawings made by a 10-year-old. This boy had had such severe temper tantrums,</a><a name="ts_50890570_50895750_" > learning disabilities, and overall difficulties with self-organization that he could not be handled in</a><a name="ts_50895750_50903170_" > school. His first family portrait, drawn before treatment started, was at the developmental level</a><a name="ts_50903170_50909470_" > of a three-year-old. Less than five weeks later, after 20 sessions of neurofeedback, his tantrums had</a><a name="ts_50909470_50917184_" > decreased and his drawing showed a marked improvement in complexity. Ten weeks and another 20 sessions later,</a><a name="ts_50917792_50924670_" > his drawing took another leap in complexity and his behavior normalized.

At Seaburn&#x27;s office in Northampton, Massachusetts, she showed me her neurofeedback</a><a name="ts_50945870_50953740_" > equipment, two desktop computers and a small amplifier, and some of the data she had collected. She then</a><a name="ts_50953740_50960890_" > pasted one electrode on each side of my skull and another on my right ear. Soon, the computer in front of</a><a name="ts_50960890_50966750_" > me was displaying rows of brain waves, like the ones I&#x27;d seen on the sleep lab polygraph three decades</a><a name="ts_50966750_50974030_" > earlier. Seaburn&#x27;s tiny laptop could detect, record, and display the electrical symphony of my brain</a><a name="ts_50974590_50979510_" > faster and more precisely than what had probably been a million dollars&#x27; worth of equipment in</a><a name="ts_50979510_50986560_" > Hartman&#x27;s lab. As Seaburn explained, feedback provides the brain with a mirror of its own function,</a><a name="ts_50987360_50993910_" > the oscillations and rhythms that underpin the currents and cross currents of the mind. Neurofeedback</a><a name="ts_50993910_51000720_" > nudges the brain to make more of some frequencies and less of others, creating new patterns that enhance</a><a name="ts_51000720_51008290_" > its natural complexity and its bias toward self-regulation. In effect, she told me, we may</a><a name="ts_51008290_51014912_" > be freeing up innate but stuck oscillatory properties in the brain and allowing new ones to develop.</a><a name="ts_51014912_51017440_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_51017440_51023540_" > Seaburn adjusted some settings to set the reward and inhibit frequencies, as she explained, so that the</a><a name="ts_51023540_51031110_" > feedback would reinforce selected brain wave patterns while discouraging others. Now, I was looking at</a><a name="ts_51031110_51036940_" > something like a video game featuring three spaceships of different colors. The computer was emitting</a><a name="ts_51036940_51043460_" > irregular tones, and the spaceships were moving quite randomly. I discovered that when I blinked my</a><a name="ts_51043460_51049790_" > eyes, they stopped. And when I calmly stared at the screen, they moved in tandem, accompanied by</a><a name="ts_51049790_51056980_" > regular beeps. Seaburn then encouraged me to make the green spaceship move ahead of the others. I leaned</a><a name="ts_51056980_51063630_" > forward to concentrate. But the harder I tried, the more the green spaceship fell behind. She smiled and</a><a name="ts_51063630_51069730_" > told me that I&#x27;d do much better if I just relax and let my brain take in the feedback that the computer was</a><a name="ts_51069730_51076620_" > generating. So I sat back, and after a while, the tones grew steadier, and the green spaceship</a><a name="ts_51076620_51085790_" > started pulling ahead of the others. I felt calm and focused, and my spaceship was winning. In some</a><a name="ts_51085790_51092850_" > ways, neurofeedback is similar to watching someone&#x27;s face during a conversation. If you see smiles or slight</a><a name="ts_51092850_51100290_" > nods, you&#x27;re rewarded, and you go on telling your story or making your point. But the moment your</a><a name="ts_51100290_51106176_" > conversation partner looks bored or shifts their gaze, you&#x27;ll start to wrap up or change the topic. In</a><a name="ts_51106176_51107744_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_51107744_51114090_" > neurofeedback, the reward is a tone or movement on the screen instead of a smile. And the inhibition</a><a name="ts_51114090_51122590_" > is far more neutral than a frown. It&#x27;s simply an undesired pattern. Next, Seaburn introduced another</a><a name="ts_51122590_51129910_" > feature of neurofeedback, its ability to track circuitry in specific parts of the brain. She moved</a><a name="ts_51129910_51138010_" > the electrodes from my temples to my left brow, and I started to feel sharp and focused. She told me she</a><a name="ts_51138010_51144600_" > was rewarding beta waves in my frontal cortex, which accounted for my alertness. When she moved the</a><a name="ts_51144600_51150270_" > electrodes to the crown of my head, I felt more detached from the computer images and more aware</a><a name="ts_51150270_51156780_" > of the sensations in my body. Afterwards, she showed me a summary graph that recorded how my brainwaves</a><a name="ts_51156780_51164980_" > had changed as I experienced subtle shifts in my mental state and physical sensations. How could</a><a name="ts_51164980_51172230_" > neurofeedback be used to help treat trauma? As Seaburn explained, with neurofeedback, we hope to intervene</a><a name="ts_51172230_51180110_" > in the circuitry that promotes and sustains states of fear and traits of fearfulness, shame, and rage. It is the</a><a name="ts_51180110_51186490_" > repetitive firing of these circuits that defines trauma. Patients need to help change the habitual</a><a name="ts_51186490_51193450_" > brain patterns created by trauma and its aftermath. When the fear patterns relax, the brain becomes less</a><a name="ts_51193450_51199770_" > susceptible to automatic stress reactions and better able to focus on ordinary events. After all,</a><a name="ts_51200250_51206944_" > stress is not an inherent property of events themselves.

The birth of neurofeedback. Neurofeedback was not a new technology in 2007.</a><a name="ts_51224410_51225600_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_51225600_51231880_" > As early as the late 1950s, University of Chicago psychology professor Joe Camilla, who was studying</a><a name="ts_51231880_51237590_" > the phenomenon of internal perception, had discovered that people could learn through feedback to tell when</a><a name="ts_51237590_51244270_" > they were producing alpha waves, which were associated with relaxation. It took some subjects only four</a><a name="ts_51244270_51251300_" > days to reach 100 percent accuracy. He then demonstrated that they could also enter voluntarily</a><a name="ts_51251300_51260240_" > into an alpha state in response to a simple sound cue. In 1968, an article about Camilla&#x27;s work was</a><a name="ts_51260240_51266420_" > published in the popular magazine Psychology Today, and the idea that alpha training could relieve stress</a><a name="ts_51266420_51273690_" > and stress-related conditions became widely known. The first scientific work showing that neurofeedback</a><a name="ts_51273690_51281630_" > could have an effect on pathological conditions was done by Barry Sturman at UCLA. The National Aeronautics</a><a name="ts_51281630_51288600_" > and Space Administration had asked Sturman to study the toxicity of a rocket fuel, monomethyl hydrazine,</a><a name="ts_51288760_51296290_" > known as MMH, which was known to cause hallucinations, nausea, and seizures. Sturman had previously trained</a><a name="ts_51296290_51304350_" > some cats to produce a specific EEG frequency known as the sensory motor rhythm. In cats, this alert,</a><a name="ts_51304350_51311530_" > focused state is associated with waiting to be fed. He discovered that while his ordinary lab cats</a><a name="ts_51311530_51318960_" > developed seizures after exposure to MMH, the cats that had received neurofeedback did not. The training</a><a name="ts_51318960_51327830_" > had somehow stabilized their brains. In 1971, Sturman attached his first human subject, 23-year-old Mary Fairbanks,</a><a name="ts_51327990_51334360_" > to a neurofeedback device. She had suffered from epilepsy since the age of eight, with grand mal seizures</a><a name="ts_51334360_51341664_" > two or more times a month. She trained for an hour a day, twice a week. At the end of three months,</a><a name="ts_51342272_51348830_" > she was virtually seizure-free. Sturman subsequently received a grant from the National Institutes of</a><a name="ts_51348830_51354176_" > Health to conduct a more systematic study, and the impressive results were published in the journal</a><a name="ts_51354816_51364030_" > Epilepsia in 1978. This period of experimentation and huge optimism about the potential of the human</a><a name="ts_51364030_51373150_" > mind came to an end in the middle of the 1970s with newly discovered psychiatric drugs. Psychiatry and brain</a><a name="ts_51373150_51378570_" > science adopted a chemical model of mind and brain, and other treatment approaches were relegated</a><a name="ts_51378570_51385900_" > to the back burner. Since then, the field of neurofeedback has grown by fits and starts,</a><a name="ts_51386140_51392880_" > with much of the scientific groundwork being done in Europe, Russia, and Australia. Even though there are</a><a name="ts_51392880_51398320_" > about 10,000 neurofeedback practitioners in the United States, the practice has not been able to garner the</a><a name="ts_51398320_51404940_" > research funding necessary to gain widespread acceptance. One reason may be that there are multiple</a><a name="ts_51404940_51412880_" > competing neurofeedback systems. Another is that the commercial potential is limited. Only a few applications are</a><a name="ts_51412880_51418490_" > covered by insurance, which makes neurofeedback expensive for consumers and prevents practitioners</a><a name="ts_51418490_51428600_" > from amassing the resources necessary to do large-scale studies, from a homeless shelter to the nursing</a><a name="ts_51428600_51435904_" > station.

He&#x27;d always felt somewhat on edge and unsafe in the presence</a><a name="ts_51994670_52001010_" > of other people, even colleagues like us. Although nobody seemed to notice, he was, after all,</a><a name="ts_52001050_52009632_" > a well-respected therapist. He lived with a chronic, gnawing sense of danger. That feeling was now gone,</a><a name="ts_52010496_52017450_" > and he felt safe, relaxed, and open. Over the next three years, Michael emerged from his habitual low</a><a name="ts_52017450_52022990_" > profile to challenge the group with his insights and opinions, and he became one of the most valuable</a><a name="ts_52022990_52030940_" > contributors to our neurofeedback program. With the help of the ANS Foundation, we started our first</a><a name="ts_52030940_52037080_" > study with a group of 17 patients who had not responded to previous treatments. We targeted the</a><a name="ts_52037080_52043200_" > right temporal area of the brain, the location that our early brain scan studies, described in chapter 3,</a><a name="ts_52044064_52051150_" > had shown to be excessively activated during traumatic stress, and gave them 20 neurofeedback sessions</a><a name="ts_52051690_52060490_" > over 10 weeks. Because most of these patients suffered from alexithymia, it was not easy for them to report</a><a name="ts_52060490_52067730_" > their response to the treatments. But their actions spoke for them. They consistently showed up on</a><a name="ts_52067730_52073696_" > time for their appointments, even if they had to drive through snowstorms. None of them dropped out,</a><a name="ts_52074272_52080490_" > and at the end of the full 20 sessions, we could document significant improvements not only in their PTSD</a><a name="ts_52080490_52088450_" > scores, but also in their interpersonal comfort, emotional balance, and self-awareness. They were less</a><a name="ts_52088450_52097740_" > frantic, they slept better, and they felt calmer and more focused. In any case, self-reports can be</a><a name="ts_52097740_52103760_" > unreliable.

His marriage had broken up around this issue,</a><a name="ts_52124890_52133140_" > and he had become HIV positive. He was desperate to gain control over his behavior. During a previous</a><a name="ts_52133140_52137920_" > therapy, he had talked extensively about his sexual abuse by an uncle at around the age of eight.</a><a name="ts_52137920_52139456_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_52139456_52144380_" > We assumed that his compulsion was related to that abuse, but making that connection had made</a><a name="ts_52144380_52150450_" > no difference in his behavior. After more than a year of regular psychotherapy with a competent</a><a name="ts_52150450_52157410_" > therapist, nothing had changed. A week after I started to train his brain to produce slower waves in</a><a name="ts_52157410_52162890_" > his right temporal lobe, he had a distressing argument with his new girlfriend, and instead of going to</a><a name="ts_52162890_52171424_" > his habitual cruising spot to find sex, he decided to go fishing. I attributed that response to change.</a><a name="ts_52172256_52177880_" > However, over the next ten weeks, in the midst of his tumultuous relationship, he continued to find</a><a name="ts_52177880_52185910_" > solace in fishing and began to renovate a lakeside cabin. When we skipped three weeks of neurofeedback</a><a name="ts_52185910_52192170_" > because of our vacation schedules, his compulsion suddenly returned, suggesting that his brain had not</a><a name="ts_52192170_52198752_" > yet stabilized its new pattern.

How did his brain come to derive comfort from fishing rather than from</a><a name="ts_52214110_52221180_" > compulsive sexual behavior? At this point, we simply didn&#x27;t know. Neurofeedback changes brain</a><a name="ts_52221180_52229770_" > connectivity patterns. The mind follows by creating new patterns of engagement. Brainwave basics,</a><a name="ts_52230330_52237728_" > from slow to fast. Each line on an EEG charts the activity in a different part of the brain. A</a><a name="ts_52238560_52245590_" > mixture of different rhythms ranged on the scale from slow to fast. The EEG consists of measurements of</a><a name="ts_52245590_52254050_" > varying heights, known as amplitude, and wavelengths, known as frequency. Frequency refers to the number of</a><a name="ts_52254050_52262230_" > times a waveform rises and falls in one second, and it is measured in hertz, or cycles per second, known as CPS.</a><a name="ts_52262230_52267712_" > Every frequency on the EEG is relevant to understanding and treating trauma, and the</a><a name="ts_52268256_52276670_" > basics are relatively easy to grasp. Delta waves, the slowest frequencies, from 2 to 5 hertz, are seen</a><a name="ts_52276670_52284640_" > most often during sleep. The brain is in an idling state, and the mind is turned inward. If people have</a><a name="ts_52284640_52290270_" > too much slow-wave activity while they&#x27;re awake, their thinking is foggy, and they exhibit poor judgment and</a><a name="ts_52290270_52299030_" > poor impulse control. 80% of children with ADHD, and many individuals diagnosed with PTSD, have excessive</a><a name="ts_52299030_52309270_" > slow waves in their frontal lobes. Dreaming speeds up brainwaves. Theta frequencies, from 5 to 8 hertz,</a><a name="ts_52309810_52314910_" > predominate at the edge of sleep, as in the floating hypnopompic state I described in chapter 15</a><a name="ts_52314910_52323540_" > on EMDR. They are also characteristic of hypnotic trance states. Theta waves create a frame of mind</a><a name="ts_52323540_52328980_" > unconstrained by logic or by the ordinary demands of life, and thus open the potential for making</a><a name="ts_52328980_52336300_" > novel connections and associations. One of the most promising EEG neural feedback treatments for PTSD,</a><a name="ts_52336300_52337376_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_52337376_52344470_" > alpha-theta training, makes use of that quality to loosen frozen associations and facilitate new</a><a name="ts_52344470_52355490_" > learning. On the downside, theta frequencies also occur when we&#x27;re out of it, or depressed. Alpha waves,</a><a name="ts_52355490_52362170_" > from 8 to 12 hertz, are accompanied by a sense of peace and calm. They are familiar to anyone who</a><a name="ts_52362170_52367680_" > has learned mindfulness meditation. A patient once told me that neurofeedback worked for him</a><a name="ts_52368224_52375530_" > like meditation on steroids. I use alpha training most often in my practice to help people who are</a><a name="ts_52375530_52383790_" > either too numb or too agitated to achieve a state of focused relaxation. Walter Reed National Military</a><a name="ts_52383790_52388950_" > Medical Center recently introduced alpha training instruments to treat soldiers with PTSD,</a><a name="ts_52388950_52397030_" > but at the time of this writing, the results are not yet available. Beta waves are the fastest</a><a name="ts_52397030_52405660_" > frequencies from 13 to 20 hertz. When they dominate, the brain is oriented to the outside world. Beta enables</a><a name="ts_52405660_52413240_" > us to engage in focused attention while performing a task. However, high beta, which is over 20 hertz,</a><a name="ts_52413240_52414240_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_52414240_52422580_" > is associated with agitation, anxiety, and body tenseness. In effect, we are constantly scanning the environment for</a><a name="ts_52422580_52433930_" > danger, helping the brain to focus. Neurofeedback training can improve creativity, athletic control,</a><a name="ts_52434450_52441120_" > and inner awareness, even in people who already are highly accomplished. When we started to study</a><a name="ts_52441120_52446870_" > neurofeedback, we discovered that sports medicine was the only department in Boston University that had</a><a name="ts_52446870_52454464_" > any familiarity with the subject. One of my earliest teachers in brain physiology was the sports psychologist,</a><a name="ts_52455104_52462410_" > Len Zikowski, who soon left Boston to train the Vancouver Canucks with neurofeedback. Neurofeedback has</a><a name="ts_52462410_52467488_" > probably been studied more thoroughly for performance enhancement than for psychiatric problems. In</a><a name="ts_52467488_52468736_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_52468736_52475000_" > Italy, the trainer for the soccer club AC Milan used it to help players remain relaxed and focused as they</a><a name="ts_52475000_52482120_" > watched videos of their errors. Their increased mental and physiological control paid off when several</a><a name="ts_52482120_52488560_" > players joined the Italian team that won the 2006 World Cup and when AC Milan won the European</a><a name="ts_52488560_52495030_" > championship the following year. Neurofeedback was also included in the science and technology component of</a><a name="ts_52495030_52504470_" > Own the podium, a $117 million five-year plan engineered to help Canada dominate the 2010 Winter Olympics in</a><a name="ts_52504470_52513660_" > Vancouver. The Canadians won the most gold medals and came in third overall. Musical performance has been</a><a name="ts_52513660_52520050_" > shown to benefit as well. A panel of judges from Britain&#x27;s Royal College of Music found that students who were</a><a name="ts_52520050_52527190_" > trained with 10 sessions of neurofeedback by John Gruslier of the University of London had a 10% improvement in the</a><a name="ts_52527190_52534080_" > performance of a piece of music compared with students who had not received neurofeedback. This represents</a><a name="ts_52534080_52540820_" > a huge difference in such a competitive field. Given its enhancement of focus, attention, and concentration,</a><a name="ts_52541696_52547880_" > it&#x27;s not surprising that neurofeedback drew the attention of specialists in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity</a><a name="ts_52547880_52557020_" > Disorder, or ADHD. At least 36 studies have shown that neurofeedback can be an effective and time-limited</a><a name="ts_52557020_52564110_" > treatment for ADHD. One that&#x27;s about as effective as conventional drugs. Once the brain has been</a><a name="ts_52564110_52569184_" > trained to produce different patterns of electrical communication, no further treatment is necessary,</a><a name="ts_52569760_52575520_" > in contrast to drugs which don&#x27;t change fundamental brain activity and work only as long as the patient</a><a name="ts_52575520_52586810_" > keeps taking them. Where is the problem in my brain? Sophisticated computerized EEG analysis,</a><a name="ts_52586810_52598770_" > known as the quantitative EEG, or QEEG, can trace brainwave activity millisecond by millisecond, and its</a><a name="ts_52598770_52604030_" > software can convert the activity into a color map that shows which frequencies are highest or lowest in</a><a name="ts_52604030_52612192_" > key areas of the brain. The QEEG can also show how well brain regions are communicating or working together.</a><a name="ts_52612192_52613344_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_52613344_52620120_" > Several large QEEG databases of both normal and abnormal patterns are available, which allows us to compare</a><a name="ts_52620120_52627160_" > a patient&#x27;s QEEG with those of thousands of other people with similar issues. Last but not least,</a><a name="ts_52627400_52638510_" > in contrast to fMRIs and related scans, the QEEG is both relatively inexpensive and portable. The QEEG</a><a name="ts_52638510_52646230_" > provides compelling evidence of the arbitrary boundaries of current DSM diagnostic categories. DSM labels for</a><a name="ts_52646230_52653500_" > mental illness are not aligned with specific patterns of brain activation. Mental states that are common to many</a><a name="ts_52653500_52661370_" > diagnoses such as confusion, agitation, or feeling disembodied are associated with specific patterns</a><a name="ts_52661370_52669856_" > on the QEEG. In general, the more problems a patient has, the more abnormalities show up in the QEEG. Our</a><a name="ts_52669856_52671296_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_52671296_52675870_" > patients find it very helpful to be able to see the patterns of localized electrical activity in their</a><a name="ts_52675870_52682370_" > brains. We can show them the patterns that seem to be responsible for their difficulty focusing or for their</a><a name="ts_52682370_52688650_" > lack of emotional control. They can see why different brain areas need to be trained to generate different</a><a name="ts_52688650_52695950_" > frequencies and communication patterns. These explanations help them shift from self-blaming</a><a name="ts_52695950_52702140_" > attempts to control their behavior to learning to process information differently. As Ed Hamlin,</a><a name="ts_52702280_52708576_" > who trained us in interpreting the QEEG, recently wrote to me, many people respond to the training,</a><a name="ts_52709248_52713800_" > but the ones that respond best and quickest are those that can see how the feedback is related to</a><a name="ts_52713800_52720064_" > something they are doing. For example, if I&#x27;m attempting to help someone increase their ability to be present,</a><a name="ts_52720640_52724380_" > we can see how they&#x27;re doing with it. Then the benefit really begins to accumulate.</a><a name="ts_52724380_52729970_" > There&#x27;s something very empowering about having the experience of changing your brain&#x27;s activity</a><a name="ts_52729970_52741820_" > with your mind.

In our neurofeedback lab, we see individuals with</a><a name="ts_52741820_52747890_" > long histories of traumatic stress who have only partially responded to existing treatments. Their</a><a name="ts_52747890_52755410_" > QEEGs show a variety of different patterns.

This means that</a><a name="ts_52761800_52768420_" > their hyper-aroused emotional brains dominate their mental life. Our research showed that</a><a name="ts_52768420_52773888_" > calming the fear center decreases trauma-based problems and improves executive functioning.

The Australian Department of Defense asked his research group to measure the effects of</a><a name="ts_52837970_52845040_" > deployment to combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan on mental and biological functioning, including brainwave</a><a name="ts_52845040_52853330_" > patterns. In the initial phase, McFarlane and his colleagues measured the QEEG and 179 combat troops</a><a name="ts_52853330_52859104_" > four months prior to and four months after each successive deployment to the Middle East. They</a><a name="ts_52859104_52860672_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_52860672_52866110_" > found that the total number of months in combat over a three-year period was associated with progressive</a><a name="ts_52866110_52873370_" > decreases in alpha power at the back of the brain. This area, which monitors the state of the body</a><a name="ts_52873370_52879850_" > and regulates such elementary processes as sleep and hunger, ordinarily has the highest level of alpha</a><a name="ts_52879850_52886660_" > waves of any region in the brain, particularly when people close their eyes. As we&#x27;ve seen,</a><a name="ts_52886660_52895300_" > alpha is associated with relaxation. The decrease in alpha power in these soldiers reflects a state of</a><a name="ts_52895300_52902040_" > persistent agitation. At the same time, the brainwaves at the front of the brain, which normally have</a><a name="ts_52902040_52909090_" > high levels of beta, show a progressive slowing with each deployment. The soldiers gradually develop</a><a name="ts_52909090_52914710_" > frontal lobe activity that resembles that of children with ADHD, which interferes with their</a><a name="ts_52914710_52922490_" > executive functioning and capacity for focused attention. The net effect is that arousal,</a><a name="ts_52922490_52928410_" > which is supposed to provide us with the energy needed to engage in day-to-day tasks, no longer</a><a name="ts_52928410_52937290_" > helps these soldiers to focus on ordinary tasks. It simply makes them agitated and restless. At this</a><a name="ts_52937290_52943890_" > stage of McFarland&#x27;s study, it&#x27;s too early to know if any of these soldiers will develop PTSD, and only time</a><a name="ts_52943890_52953490_" > will tell to what degree these brains will readjust to the pace of civilian life. Neurofeedback and learning</a><a name="ts_52953490_52960830_" > disabilities. Chronic abuse and neglect in childhood interfere with the proper wiring of sensory</a><a name="ts_52960830_52966510_" > integration systems. In some cases, this results in learning disabilities, which include faulty</a><a name="ts_52966510_52974990_" > connections between the auditory and word processing systems and poor hand-eye coordination. As long as they</a><a name="ts_52974990_52981200_" > are frozen or explosive, it&#x27;s difficult to see how much trouble the adolescents in our residential treatment</a><a name="ts_52981200_52987370_" > programs have processing day-to-day information. But once their behavioral problems have been</a><a name="ts_52987370_52994750_" > successfully treated, their learning disabilities often become manifest. Even if these traumatized</a><a name="ts_52994750_53000680_" > kids could sit still and pay attention, many of them would still be handicapped by their poor learning</a><a name="ts_53000680_53009530_" > skills. Lisa described how trauma had interfered with the proper wiring of basic processing functions.</a><a name="ts_53009530_53017088_" > She told me she always got lost going places. And she recalled having a marked auditory delay that</a><a name="ts_53017696_53024672_" > kept her from being able to follow the instructions from teachers.

Neurofeedback helped</a><a name="ts_53040730_53047530_" > her to reverse these learning disabilities. She said, I learned to keep track of things. For example,</a><a name="ts_53047530_53052740_" > to read maps.

Now is the time to study whether</a><a name="ts_53114890_53126520_" > neurofeedback can succeed where other interventions have failed. Alpha-theta training. Alpha-theta</a><a name="ts_53126520_53132190_" > training is a particularly fascinating neurofeedback procedure because it can induce the sorts of</a><a name="ts_53132190_53140130_" > hypnagogic states, the essence of hypnotic trance, that are discussed in chapter 15. When theta waves</a><a name="ts_53140130_53147590_" > predominate in the brain, the mind&#x27;s focus is on the internal world, a world of free-floating imagery. Alpha-brain</a><a name="ts_53147590_53154840_" > waves may act as a bridge from the external world to the internal and vice versa. In alpha-theta training,</a><a name="ts_53154840_53161970_" > these frequencies are alternately rewarded. The challenge in PTSD is to open the mind to new</a><a name="ts_53161970_53167648_" > possibilities so that the present is no longer interpreted as a continuous reliving of the past.</a><a name="ts_53167648_53169216_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_53169216_53174650_" > Trance states, during which theta activity dominates, can help to loosen the conditioned connections</a><a name="ts_53174650_53182848_" > between particular stimuli and responses, such as loud cracks signaling gunfire or harbinger of death.</a><a name="ts_53182848_53184736_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_53184736_53191010_" > A new association can be created in which that same crack can come to be linked to 4th of July</a><a name="ts_53191010_53199320_" > fireworks at the end of a day at the beach with loved ones. In the twilight states fostered by alpha-theta</a><a name="ts_53199320_53208030_" > training, traumatic events may be safely re-experienced and new associations fostered. Some patients report</a><a name="ts_53208030_53216980_" > unusual imagery and or deep insights about their life. Others simply become more relaxed and less rigid. Any state in</a><a name="ts_53216980_53222280_" > which people can safely experience images, feelings and emotions that are associated with dread and</a><a name="ts_53222280_53231360_" > helplessness is likely to create fresh potential and a wider perspective. Can alpha-theta reverse</a><a name="ts_53231360_53239890_" > hyperarousal patterns? The accumulated evidence is promising. Eugene Penniston and Paul Krakowski,</a><a name="ts_53240110_53247480_" > researchers at the VA Medical Center in Fort Lyon, Colorado, used neurofeedback to tweak 29 Vietnam veterans</a><a name="ts_53247480_53256790_" > with a 12 to 15-year history of chronic combat-related PTSD. 15 of the men were randomly assigned to the</a><a name="ts_53256790_53264580_" > EEG alpha-theta training and 14 to a control group that received standard medical care, including psychotropic</a><a name="ts_53264580_53273060_" > drugs and individual and group therapy. On average, participants in both groups had been hospitalized more</a><a name="ts_53273060_53281230_" > than five times for their PTSD. The neurofeedback facilitated twilight states of learning by rewarding both</a><a name="ts_53281230_53286720_" > alpha-alpha and theta waves. As the men lay back in a recliner with their eyes closed, they were</a><a name="ts_53287424_53293990_" > coached to allow the neurofeedback sounds to guide them into deep relaxation. They were also asked to</a><a name="ts_53293990_53301460_" > use positive mental imagery, for example, being sober or living confidently and happily, as they moved</a><a name="ts_53301460_53309740_" > toward the trance-like alpha-theta state. This study, published in 1991, had one of the best outcomes</a><a name="ts_53309740_53316992_" > ever recorded for PTSD. The neurofeedback group had a significant decrease in their PTSD symptoms,</a><a name="ts_53317568_53325650_" > as well as in physical complaints, depression, anxiety, and paranoia. After the treatment phase,</a><a name="ts_53325770_53332800_" > the veterans and their family members were contacted monthly for a period of 30 months. Only three of</a><a name="ts_53333376_53342050_" > the 15 neurofeedback-treated veterans reported disturbing flashbacks and nightmares. All three chose to undergo 10</a><a name="ts_53342050_53350220_" > booster sessions. Only one needed to return to the hospital for further treatment. 14 out of 15 were using</a><a name="ts_53350220_53356580_" > significantly less medication. In contrast, every vet in the comparison group experienced an</a><a name="ts_53356580_53362250_" > increase in PTSD symptoms during the follow-up period, and all of them required at least two</a><a name="ts_53362250_53369980_" > further hospitalizations. 10 of the comparison group also increased their medication use. This study</a><a name="ts_53369980_53375430_" > has been replicated by other researchers, but it has received surprisingly little attention outside the</a><a name="ts_53375430_53388650_" > neurofeedback community. Neurofeedback, PTSD, and addiction. Approximately one-third to one-half of</a><a name="ts_53388650_53395260_" > severely traumatized people developed substance abuse problems. Since the time of Homer, soldiers have</a><a name="ts_53395260_53402510_" > used alcohol to numb their pain, irritability, and depression. In one recent study, half of motor vehicle</a><a name="ts_53402510_53410530_" > accident victims developed problems with drugs or alcohol. Alcohol abuse makes people careless and thus increases</a><a name="ts_53410530_53416170_" > their chances of being traumatized again. Although being drunk during an assault actually decreases the</a><a name="ts_53416170_53427350_" > likelihood of PTSD. There is a circular relationship between PTSD and substance abuse. While drugs and</a><a name="ts_53427350_53433400_" > alcohol may provide temporary relief from trauma symptoms, withdrawing from them increases hyperarousal,</a><a name="ts_53433800_53440640_" > thereby intensifying nightmares, flashbacks, and irritability. There are only two ways to end this</a><a name="ts_53440640_53449520_" > vicious cycle. One is by resolving the symptoms of PTSD with methods such as EMDR, or two, by treating the</a><a name="ts_53449520_53456630_" > hyperarousal hyperarousal that is part of both PTSD and withdrawal from drugs and alcohol. Drugs such</a><a name="ts_53456630_53461670_" > as naltrexone are sometimes prescribed to reduce hyperarousal, but this treatment helps in only some</a><a name="ts_53461670_53468032_" > cases. One of the first women I trained with neurofeedback had a long-standing cocaine addiction,</a><a name="ts_53468576_53474420_" > in addition to an horrendous childhood history of sexual abuse and abandonment. Much to my surprise,</a><a name="ts_53474580_53479930_" > her cocaine habit cleared after the first two sessions, and on follow-up five years later,</a><a name="ts_53479930_53486220_" > had not returned. I had never seen anyone recover this quickly from severe drug abuse, so</a><a name="ts_53486220_53492180_" > I turned to the existing scientific literature for guidance. Most of the studies on this subject</a><a name="ts_53492180_53497630_" > were done more than two decades ago. In recent years, very few neurofeedback studies for the</a><a name="ts_53497630_53504790_" > treatment of addiction have been published, at least in the United States. Between 75 and 80 percent of</a><a name="ts_53504790_53512380_" > patients who are admitted for detox and alcohol and drug abuse treatment will relapse. Another study</a><a name="ts_53512380_53516700_" > by Penniston and Kolkowski on the effects of neurofeedback training with veterans who had</a><a name="ts_53516700_53525010_" > dual diagnoses of alcoholism and PTSD focused on this problem. Fifteen veterans received alpha-theta</a><a name="ts_53525010_53531810_" > training, while the control group received standard treatment without neurofeedback. The subjects were</a><a name="ts_53531810_53537530_" > followed up regularly for three years, during which eight members of the neurofeedback group stopped</a><a name="ts_53537530_53545970_" > drinking completely, and one got drunk once but became sick and didn&#x27;t drink again. Most of them were</a><a name="ts_53545970_53552450_" > markedly less depressed. As Penniston put it, the changes reported corresponded to being more</a><a name="ts_53552450_53558490_" > warm-hearted, more intelligent, more emotionally stable, more socially bold, more relaxed, and more</a><a name="ts_53558490_53565530_" > satisfied. In contrast, all of those given standard treatment were readmitted to the hospital within 18</a><a name="ts_53565530_53572960_" > months. Since that time, a number of studies on neurofeedback for addictions have been published. But this</a><a name="ts_53572960_53583160_" > important application needs much more research to establish its potential and limitations. The future of</a><a name="ts_53583160_53590060_" > is neurofeedback. In my practice, I use neurofeedback primarily to help with the hyperarousal,</a><a name="ts_53590180_53596690_" > confusion, and concentration problems of people who suffer from developmental trauma. However, it has</a><a name="ts_53596690_53601344_" > also shown good results for numerous issues and conditions that go beyond the scope of this book,</a><a name="ts_53602048_53607552_" > including relieving tension headaches, improving cognitive functioning following a traumatic brain injury,</a><a name="ts_53607552_53608576_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_53608576_53615980_" > reducing anxiety and panic attacks, learning to deepen meditation states, treating autism, improving</a><a name="ts_53615980_53625000_" > seizure control, self-regulation and mood disorders, and more. As of 2013, neurofeedback is being used</a><a name="ts_53625000_53633320_" > in 17 military and VA facilities to treat PTSD. The scientific documentation of its efficacy in recent combat</a><a name="ts_53633320_53642310_" > vets is just beginning to be assessed. Frank Duffy, the director of the Clinical Neurophysiology and the</a><a name="ts_53642310_53647700_" > Developmental Neurophysiology Laboratories of Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, has commented,</a><a name="ts_53647700_53654050_" > The literature, which lacks any negative study, suggests that neurofeedback plays a major therapeutic</a><a name="ts_53654050_53660010_" > role in many different areas. In my opinion, if any medication had demonstrated such a wide</a><a name="ts_53660010_53669280_" > spectrum of efficacy, it would be universally accepted and widely used. Many questions remain</a><a name="ts_53669280_53674390_" > to be answered about treatment protocols for neurofeedback, but the scientific paradigm is</a><a name="ts_53674390_53681230_" > gradually shifting in a direction that invites a deeper exploration of these questions. In 2010,</a><a name="ts_53681230_53687390_" > Thomas Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health, published an article in Scientific</a><a name="ts_53687390_53694432_" > American entitled, Faulty Circuits, in which he called for a return to understanding mind and brain in</a><a name="ts_53694976_53700864_" > terms of rhythms and patterns of electrical communication. He wrote,</a><a name="ts_53701664_53707830_" > Brain regions that function together to carry out normal and abnormal mental operations can be thought of</a><a name="ts_53707830_53714700_" > as analogous to electrical circuits. The latest research shows that the malfunctioning of entire circuits may</a><a name="ts_53714700_53724280_" > underlie many mental disorders. Three years later, Insel announced that NIMH was reorienting its research</a><a name="ts_53724280_53733000_" > away from DSM categories and focusing instead on disorders of the human connectome. As explained by</a><a name="ts_53733000_53740230_" > Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, of which NIMH is a part, the connectome refers</a><a name="ts_53740230_53748010_" > to the exquisitely interconnected network of neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain. Like the genome, the microbiome,</a><a name="ts_53748010_53753950_" > and other exciting ohm fields, the effort to map the connectome and decipher the electrical signals</a><a name="ts_53753950_53759890_" > that zap through it to generate your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors has become possible through</a><a name="ts_53759890_53766050_" > development of powerful new tools and technologies. The connectome is now being mapped in detail under the</a><a name="ts_53766050_53774710_" > auspices of NIMH. As we await the results of this research, I&#x27;d like to give the last word to Lisa,</a><a name="ts_53774950_53781480_" > the survivor who introduced me to the enormous potential of neurofeedback. When I asked her to summarize what the</a><a name="ts_53781480_53788450_" > treatment had done for her, she said, it calmed me down. It stopped the dissociation. I can use my</a><a name="ts_53788450_53794300_" > feelings. I&#x27;m not running away from them. I&#x27;m not held hostage by them. I can&#x27;t turn them off and on,</a><a name="ts_53795104_53802580_" > but I can put them away. I may be sad about the abuse I went through, but I can put it away.

Being adored by girls and keeping an</a><a name="ts_53981600_53987220_" > audience spellbound became the real tipping point in his recovery. Unlike his experience with the</a><a name="ts_53987220_53993230_" > numerous therapists who had talked with him about how bad he felt, theater gave him a chance to deeply and</a><a name="ts_53993230_53999210_" > physically experience what it was like to be someone other than the learning disabled, oversensitive</a><a name="ts_53999210_54006230_" > boy that he had gradually become. Being a valued contributor to a group gave him a visceral experience</a><a name="ts_54006230_54012280_" > of power and competence. I believe that this new embodied version of himself set him on the road</a><a name="ts_54012280_54021010_" > to becoming the creative, loving adult he is today. Our sense of agency, how much we feel in control,</a><a name="ts_54021984_54028930_" > is defined by our relationship with our bodies and its rhythms. Our waking and sleeping and how we eat,</a><a name="ts_54028930_54036750_" > sit and walk, define the contours of our days. In order to find our voice, we have to be in our</a><a name="ts_54036750_54044630_" > bodies, able to breathe fully and able to access our inner sensations. This is the opposite of dissociation,</a><a name="ts_54044810_54051808_" > of being out of body and making yourself disappear. It&#x27;s also the opposite of depression,</a><a name="ts_54052448_54058670_" > lying slumped in front of a screen that provides passive entertainment. Acting is an experience of using</a><a name="ts_54058670_54069560_" > your body to take your place in life. The theater of war. Nick&#x27;s transformation was not the first time</a><a name="ts_54069560_54075350_" > I&#x27;d witnessed the benefits of theater. In 1988, I was still treating three veterans with PTSD</a><a name="ts_54075890_54081470_" > whom I&#x27;d met at the VA. And when they showed a sudden improvement in their vitality, optimism,</a><a name="ts_54081550_54088270_" > and family relationships, I attributed it to my growing therapeutic skills. Then I discovered that</a><a name="ts_54088270_54094630_" > all three were involved in a theatrical production. Wanting to dramatize the plight of homeless veterans,</a><a name="ts_54095488_54100560_" > they had persuaded playwright David Mamet, who was living nearby, to meet weekly with their group</a><a name="ts_54100560_54107300_" > to develop a script around their experiences. Mamet then recruited Al Pacino, Donald Sutherland,</a><a name="ts_54107400_54114220_" > and Michael J. Fox to come to Boston for an evening called Sketches of War, which raised money to</a><a name="ts_54114220_54121380_" > convert the VA clinic where I&#x27;d meet my patients into a shelter for homeless veterans. Standing on a stage</a><a name="ts_54121380_54126816_" > with professional actors, speaking about their memories of the war, and reading their poetry was</a><a name="ts_54127424_54137152_" > clearly a more transformative experience than any therapy could have offered them. Since time immemorial,</a><a name="ts_54137696_54142944_" > human beings have used communal rituals to cope with their most powerful and terrifying feelings.</a><a name="ts_54142944_54144064_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54144064_54148500_" > Ancient Greek theater, the oldest of which we have written records, seems to have grown out of</a><a name="ts_54148500_54156090_" > religious rites that involved dancing, singing, and reenacting mythical stories. By the 5th century BCE,</a><a name="ts_54157024_54161620_" > theater played a central role in civic life, with the audience seated in a horseshoe around the stage,</a><a name="ts_54161780_54168010_" > which enabled them to see one another&#x27;s emotions and reactions. Greek drama may have served as a</a><a name="ts_54168010_54173930_" > ritual reintegration for combat veterans. At the time, Aeschylus wrote the Oresteia trilogy,</a><a name="ts_54174650_54181350_" > Athens was at war on six fronts. The cycle of tragedy is set in motion when the returning warrior king,</a><a name="ts_54181690_54187550_" > Agamemnon, is murdered by his wife, Clytemnestra, for having sacrificed their daughter before sailing to</a><a name="ts_54187550_54195300_" > the Trojan War. Military service was required of every adult citizen of Athens, so audiences were undoubtedly</a><a name="ts_54195300_54201510_" > composed of combat veterans and active-duty soldiers on leave. The performers themselves must have been</a><a name="ts_54201510_54209810_" > citizen soldiers. Sophocles was a general officer in Athens&#x27; wars against the Persians, and his play,</a><a name="ts_54209970_54215810_" > Ajax, which ends with the suicide of one of the Trojan War&#x27;s greatest heroes, reads like a textbook</a><a name="ts_54215810_54224090_" > description of traumatic stress. In 2008, writer and director Brian Dorries arranged a reading of Ajax for 500</a><a name="ts_54224090_54230520_" > Marines in San Diego and was stunned by the reception to it. Like many of us who work with trauma,</a><a name="ts_54231140_54236370_" > Dorries&#x27; inspiration was personal. He had studied classics in college and turned to the Greek texts</a><a name="ts_54236370_54244070_" > for comfort when he lost a girlfriend to cystic fibrosis. His project, The Theater of War, evolved from</a><a name="ts_54244070_54251010_" > that first event. And with funding from the U.S. Department of Defense, this 2,500-year-old play has since been</a><a name="ts_54251010_54257640_" > performed more than 200 times here and abroad to give voice to the plight of combat veterans and foster</a><a name="ts_54257640_54265180_" > dialogue and understanding in their families and friends. Theater of War performances are followed</a><a name="ts_54265180_54270820_" > by a town hall-style discussion. I attended a reading of Ajax in Cambridge, Massachusetts,</a><a name="ts_54271120_54278260_" > shortly after the news media had publicized a 27% increase in suicides among combat veterans over the</a><a name="ts_54278260_54286730_" > previous three years. Some 40 people—Vietnam veterans, military wives, recently discharged men and</a><a name="ts_54286730_54293910_" > women who had served in Iraq and Afghanistan—lined up behind the microphone. Many of them quoted lines from</a><a name="ts_54293910_54299616_" > the play as they spoke about their sleepless nights, drug addiction, and alienation from their families.</a><a name="ts_54299616_54301120_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_54301120_54306320_" > The atmosphere was electric. And afterward, the audience huddled in the foyer, some holding each</a><a name="ts_54306320_54314990_" > other and crying, others in deep conversation. As Dorries later said, anyone who has come into contact</a><a name="ts_54314990_54322070_" > with extreme pain, suffering, or death has no trouble understanding Greek drama. It&#x27;s all about bearing</a><a name="ts_54322070_54336060_" > witness to the stories of veterans, keeping together in time. Collective movement and music create a larger</a><a name="ts_54336060_54342800_" > context for our lives, a meaning beyond our individual fate. Religious rituals universally</a><a name="ts_54342800_54348990_" > involved rhythmic movements, from davening at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, to the sung liturgy and</a><a name="ts_54348990_54354930_" > gestures of the Catholic Mass, to moving meditation in Buddhist ceremonies, and the rhythmic prayer rituals</a><a name="ts_54354930_54362130_" > performed five times a day by devout Muslims. Music was a backbone of the civil rights movement in the</a><a name="ts_54362130_54368340_" > United States. Anyone alive at that time will not forget the lines of marchers, arms-linked, singing,</a><a name="ts_54368340_54373728_" > We shall overcome, as they walked steadily toward the police who were amassed to stop them.</a><a name="ts_54373728_54375648_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_54375648_54381770_" > Music binds together people who might individually be terrified, but who collectively become powerful</a><a name="ts_54381770_54388190_" > advocates for themselves and others. Along with language, dancing, marching, and singing are uniquely</a><a name="ts_54388190_54396110_" > human ways to install a sense of hope and courage. I observed the force of communal rhythms and action</a><a name="ts_54396110_54401410_" > when I watched Archbishop Desmond Tutu conduct public hearings for the Truth and Reconciliation</a><a name="ts_54401410_54408864_" > Commission in South Africa in 1996. These events were framed by collective singing and dancing.</a><a name="ts_54408864_54410112_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54410112_54414560_" > Witnesses recounted the unspeakable atrocities that had been inflicted on them and their families. When</a><a name="ts_54415520_54420620_" > they became overwhelmed, Tutu would interrupt their testimony and lead the entire audience in prayer,</a><a name="ts_54420960_54426690_" > song, and dance until the witnesses could contain their sobbing and halt their physical collapse.</a><a name="ts_54426690_54433630_" > This enabled participants to pendulate in and out of reliving their horror and eventually to find</a><a name="ts_54433630_54439890_" > words to describe what had happened to them. I fully credit Tutu and the other members of the</a><a name="ts_54439890_54446560_" > commission, with averting what might have been an orgy of revenge, as is so common when victims are</a><a name="ts_54446560_54455900_" > finally set free. A few years ago, I discovered Keeping Together in Time, written by the great historian</a><a name="ts_54455900_54463950_" > William H. McNeil near the end of his career. This short book examines the historical role of dance and military</a><a name="ts_54463950_54471150_" > drill in creating what McNeil calls muscular bonding and sheds a new light on the importance of</a><a name="ts_54471150_54478112_" > theater, communal dance, and movement. It also solved a long-standing puzzle in my own mind. Having</a><a name="ts_54478112_54479136_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54479136_54484320_" > been raised in the Netherlands, I had always wondered how a group of simple Dutch peasants and fishermen had</a><a name="ts_54484896_54494070_" > won their liberation from the mighty Spanish Empire. The Eighty Years&#x27; War, which lasted from the late 16th to the mid-17th century,</a><a name="ts_54494070_54501610_" > began as a series of guerrilla actions, and it seemed destined to remain that way since the ill-disciplined,</a><a name="ts_54502090_54508950_" > ill-paid soldiers regularly fled under volleys of musket fire. This changed when Prince Maurice of Orange</a><a name="ts_54508950_54514720_" > became the leader of the Dutch rebels. Still in his early twenties, he had recently completed his schooling</a><a name="ts_54514720_54522350_" > in Latin, which enabled him to read 1,500-year-old Roman manuals on military tactics. He learned that the</a><a name="ts_54522350_54527980_" > Roman general Lycurgus had introduced marching in step to the Roman legions and that the historian</a><a name="ts_54527980_54533248_" > Plutarch had attributed their invincibility to this practice. He wrote,</a><a name="ts_54534112_54539490_" > It was at once a magnificent and terrible sight to see them march on to the tune of their flutes</a><a name="ts_54539490_54546176_" > without any disorder in their ranks, any discomposure in their minds, or change in their countenances,</a><a name="ts_54546752_54555170_" > calmly and cheerfully moving with music to the deadly fight. Prince Maurice instituted close-ordered</a><a name="ts_54555170_54562400_" > drill, accompanied by drums, flutes, and trumpets in his ragtag army. This collective ritual not only</a><a name="ts_54562400_54567020_" > provided his men with a sense of purpose and solidarity, but also made it possible for them</a><a name="ts_54567020_54574710_" > to execute complicated maneuvers. Close-ordered drill, subsequently, spread across Europe, and to this</a><a name="ts_54574710_54580450_" > day the major services of the U.S. military spend liberally on their marching bands, even though</a><a name="ts_54580450_54589030_" > fifes and drums no longer accompany troops into battle. Neuroscientist Jak Panksepp, who was born in the</a><a name="ts_54589030_54595270_" > tiny Baltic country of Estonia, told me the remarkable story of Estonia&#x27;s singing revolution.</a><a name="ts_54595270_54604570_" > In June 1987, on one of those endless sub-Arctic summer evenings, more than 10,000 concert-goers at</a><a name="ts_54604570_54610100_" > the Tallinn Song Festival grounds linked hands and began to sing patriotic songs that had been forbidden</a><a name="ts_54610100_54618150_" > during half a century of Soviet occupation. These song-fests and protests continued, and on September 11,</a><a name="ts_54618150_54625000_" > 1988, 300,000 people, about a quarter of the population of Estonia, gathered to sing and make</a><a name="ts_54625000_54632210_" > a public demand for independence. By August 1991, the Congress of Estonia had proclaimed the restoration</a><a name="ts_54632210_54638350_" > of the Estonian state, and when Soviet tanks attempted to intervene, people acted as human shields</a><a name="ts_54638350_54645088_" > to protect Tallinn&#x27;s radio and TV stations. As a columnist noted in the New York Times,</a><a name="ts_54645088_54646208_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54646208_54651410_" > Imagine the scene in Casablanca in which the French patrons sing La Marseillaise in defiance of the</a><a name="ts_54651410_54657490_" > Germans, then multiply its power by a factor of thousands, and you&#x27;ve only begun to imagine the</a><a name="ts_54657490_54669130_" > force of the singing revolution. Treating trauma through theater. It is surprising how little research</a><a name="ts_54669130_54674510_" > exists on how collective ceremonies affect the mind and brain, and how they might prevent or alleviate</a><a name="ts_54674510_54679950_" > trauma. Over the past decade, however, I have had a chance to observe and study three different</a><a name="ts_54679950_54687810_" > programs for treating trauma through theater. One, the urban improv in Boston, and the trauma-drama</a><a name="ts_54687810_54695010_" > program it inspired in the Boston public schools and in our residential centers. Two, the Possibility</a><a name="ts_54695010_54701700_" > Project, directed by Paul Griffin in New York City. And three, Shakespeare and Company in Lenox,</a><a name="ts_54701800_54709290_" > Massachusetts, which runs a program for juvenile offenders called Shakespeare in the Courts. In this</a><a name="ts_54709290_54714410_" > chapter, I&#x27;ll focus on these three groups, but there are many excellent therapeutic drama programs in the</a><a name="ts_54714410_54722190_" > United States and abroad, making theater a widely available resource for recovery. Despite their</a><a name="ts_54722190_54727640_" > differences, all these programs share a common foundation. Confrontation of the painful realities</a><a name="ts_54727640_54735072_" > of life and symbolic transformation through communal action. Love and hate, aggression and surrender,</a><a name="ts_54735776_54741920_" > loyalty and betrayal are the stuff of theater and the stuff of trauma. As a culture, we are trained</a><a name="ts_54741920_54748010_" > to cut ourselves off from the truth of what we&#x27;re feeling. In the words of Tina Packer, the charismatic</a><a name="ts_54748010_54753340_" > founder of Shakespeare and Company, training actors involves training people to go against that</a><a name="ts_54753340_54758440_" > tendency, not only to feel deeply, but to convey that feeling at every moment to the audience</a><a name="ts_54758440_54767020_" > so that the audience will get it and not close off against it. Traumatized people are terrified to</a><a name="ts_54767020_54773280_" > feel deeply. They are afraid to experience their emotions because emotions lead to loss of control. In</a><a name="ts_54773280_54774432_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54774432_54781792_" > contrast, theater is about embodying emotions, giving voice to them, becoming rhythmically engaged,</a><a name="ts_54782400_54790350_" > taking on and embodying different roles. As we&#x27;ve seen, the essence of trauma is feeling godforsaken,</a><a name="ts_54790650_54796240_" > cut off from the human race. Theater involves a collective confrontation with the realities of the</a><a name="ts_54796240_54802112_" > human condition. As Paul Griffin, discussing his theater program for foster care children, told me,</a><a name="ts_54803072_54808910_" > the stuff of tragedy in theater revolves around coping with betrayal, assault and destruction. These kids</a><a name="ts_54808910_54815800_" > have no trouble understanding what Lear, Othello, Macbeth or Hamlet are all about. And Tina Packer&#x27;s words,</a><a name="ts_54815800_54821130_" > everything is about using the whole body and having other bodies resonate with your feelings,</a><a name="ts_54821330_54827260_" > emotions and thoughts. Theater gives trauma survivors a chance to connect with one another</a><a name="ts_54827260_54835552_" > by deeply experiencing their common humanity. Traumatized people are afraid of conflict. They</a><a name="ts_54836320_54843232_" > fear losing control and ending up on the losing side once again. Conflict is central to theater. Inner</a><a name="ts_54843232_54844544_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54844544_54852980_" > conflicts, interpersonal conflicts, family conflicts, social conflicts and their consequences. Trauma is about</a><a name="ts_54852980_54860130_" > trying to stop trying to forget. Hiding how scared, enraged or helpless you are. Theater is about</a><a name="ts_54860130_54865460_" > finding ways of telling the truth and conveying deep truths to your audience. This requires pushing</a><a name="ts_54865460_54871380_" > through blockages to discover your own truth, exploring and examining your own internal experience</a><a name="ts_54871380_54884010_" > so that it can emerge in your voice and body on stage, making it safe to engage. These theater</a><a name="ts_54884010_54890270_" > programs are not for aspiring actors, but for angry, frightened and obstreperous teenagers or</a><a name="ts_54890270_54896200_" > withdrawn, alcoholic, burned out veterans. When they come to rehearsal, they slump into their chairs,</a><a name="ts_54896740_54901710_" > fearful that others will immediately see what failures they are. Traumatized adolescents</a><a name="ts_54902410_54912090_" > are a jumble. Inhibited, out of tune, inarticulate, uncoordinated and purposeless. They are too hyper</a><a name="ts_54912090_54918100_" > aroused to notice what is going on around them. They are easily triggered and rely on action rather than</a><a name="ts_54918100_54925390_" > words to discharge their feelings. All the directors I&#x27;ve worked with agree that the secret is to go slow</a><a name="ts_54925390_54931740_" > and engage them bit by bit. The initial challenge is simply to get participants to be more present</a><a name="ts_54931740_54937830_" > in the room. Here&#x27;s Kevin Coleman, director of Shakespeare and the Courts, describing his work</a><a name="ts_54937830_54944460_" > with teens when I interviewed him. First, we get them up and walking around the room. Then we start to</a><a name="ts_54944460_54949728_" > create a balance in the space so they&#x27;re not walking aimlessly but become aware of other people.</a><a name="ts_54949728_54950784_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_54950784_54957710_" > Gradually, with little prompts, it becomes more complex. Just walk on your toes or on your heels or walk</a><a name="ts_54957710_54964680_" > backwards. Then when you bump into someone, scream and fall down. After maybe 30 prompts,</a><a name="ts_54964920_54970912_" > they&#x27;re out there waving their arms in the air and we get a full body warm up. But it&#x27;s incremental.</a><a name="ts_54971904_54978570_" > If you take too big a jump, you&#x27;ll see them hit the wall. You have to make it safe for them to notice</a><a name="ts_54978570_54984670_" > each other. Once their bodies are a little more free, I might use the prompt, don&#x27;t make eye contact</a><a name="ts_54984670_54990680_" > with anyone. Just look at the floor. Most of them are thinking, great, I&#x27;m doing that already. But then I say,</a><a name="ts_54991480_54997130_" > now. Begin to notice people as you go by, but don&#x27;t let them see you looking. And next,</a><a name="ts_54997590_55006976_" > just make eye contact for a second. Then, now, no eye contact. Now, contact. Now, no contact. Now,</a><a name="ts_55006976_55008400_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55008400_55015120_" > make eye contact and hold it. Too long. You&#x27;ll know when it&#x27;s too long because you&#x27;ll either want to start</a><a name="ts_55015120_55022400_" > dating that person or to have a fight with them. That&#x27;s when it&#x27;s too long. They don&#x27;t make that kind</a><a name="ts_55022400_55027740_" > of extended eye contact in their normal lives, not even with the person they&#x27;re talking to. They don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_55027740_55033430_" > know if that person is safe or not. So what you&#x27;re doing is making it safe for them not to disappear when they</a><a name="ts_55033430_55043480_" > make eye contact or when someone looks at them, bit by bit, by bit, by bit. Traumatized adolescents</a><a name="ts_55043480_55049970_" > are noticeably out of sync. In the Trauma Center&#x27;s Trauma Drama Program, we use mirroring exercises to</a><a name="ts_55049970_55055360_" > help them get in tune with one another. They move their right arm up and their partner mirrors it.</a><a name="ts_55056096_55063250_" > They twirl and their partner twirls in response. They begin to observe how body movements and facial</a><a name="ts_55063250_55069470_" > expressions change, how their own natural movements differ from those of others, and how unaccustomed</a><a name="ts_55069470_55075730_" > movements and expressions make them feel. Mirroring loosens their preoccupation with what</a><a name="ts_55075730_55080980_" > other people think of them and helps them attune viscerally, not cognitively, to someone else&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_55080980_55088320_" > experience. When mirroring ends in giggles, it&#x27;s a sure indication that our participants feel safe.</a><a name="ts_55088320_55090944_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_55090944_55096610_" > In order to become real partners, they also need to learn to trust one another. An exercise in which one</a><a name="ts_55096610_55103510_" > person is blindfolded while his partner leads him by the hand is especially tough for our kids. It&#x27;s often as</a><a name="ts_55103510_55108570_" > terrifying for them to be the leader, to be trusted by someone vulnerable as it is to be blindfolded</a><a name="ts_55108570_55114350_" > and led. At first, they may last for only 10 or 20 seconds, but we gradually work them up to five</a><a name="ts_55114350_55120410_" > minutes. Afterward, some of them have to go off by themselves for a while because it is so emotionally</a><a name="ts_55120410_55127350_" > overwhelming to feel these connections. The traumatized kids and veterans we work with are</a><a name="ts_55127350_55132630_" > embarrassed to be seen, afraid to be in touch with what they are feeling, and they keep one another at</a><a name="ts_55132630_55139730_" > arm&#x27;s length. The job of any director, like that of any therapist, is to slow things down so the actors can</a><a name="ts_55139730_55147270_" > establish a relationship with themselves, with their bodies. Theater offers a unique way to access</a><a name="ts_55147270_55153550_" > a full range of emotions and physical sensations that not only put them in touch with the habitual</a><a name="ts_55153550_55163392_" > set of their bodies, but also let them explore alternative ways of engaging with life. Urban Improv.</a><a name="ts_55163392_55164992_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_55164992_55172050_" > My son loved his theater group, which was run by Urban Improv, known as UI, a long-standing Boston</a><a name="ts_55172050_55177440_" > arts institution. He stayed with them through high school and then volunteered to work with them the</a><a name="ts_55177440_55182830_" > summer after his freshman year of college. It was then that he learned that UI&#x27;s Violence Prevention</a><a name="ts_55182830_55188720_" > Program, which has run hundreds of workshops in local schools since 1992, had received a research</a><a name="ts_55188720_55195610_" > grant to assess its efficacy and that they were looking for someone to head the study. Nick suggested</a><a name="ts_55195610_55201248_" > to the directors, Kippy Dewey and Sissa Campion, that his dad would be the ideal person for the job.</a><a name="ts_55201248_55202432_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55202432_55204320_" > Luckily for me, they agreed.</a><a name="ts_55204320_55206560_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_55206560_55211680_" > I began to visit schools with UI&#x27;s Multicultural Ensemble, which included a director, four professional</a><a name="ts_55211680_55218730_" > actor educators, and a musician. Urban Improv creates scripted skits depicting the kinds of</a><a name="ts_55218730_55225870_" > problems that students face every day. Exclusion from peer groups, jealousy, rivalry and anger,</a><a name="ts_55226010_55232970_" > and family strife. Kids for older students also address issues like dating, STDs, homophobia,</a><a name="ts_55233230_55239460_" > and peer violence. In a typical presentation, the professional actors might portray a group of kids</a><a name="ts_55239460_55245200_" > excluding a newcomer from a lunch table in the cafeteria. As the scene approaches a choice</a><a name="ts_55245200_55251424_" > point, for example, the new student responds to their put-downs, the director freezes the action.</a><a name="ts_55251424_55252512_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55252512_55258850_" > A member of the class is then invited to replace one of the actors and show how he or she would feel</a><a name="ts_55258850_55264970_" > and behave in this situation. These scenarios enable the students to observe day-to-day problems</a><a name="ts_55264970_55271160_" > with some emotional distance while experimenting with various solutions. Will they confront the</a><a name="ts_55271160_55279190_" > tormentors? Talk to a friend? Call the homeroom teacher? Tell their parents what happened? Another</a><a name="ts_55279190_55283970_" > volunteer is then asked to try a different approach so that students can see how other choices might</a><a name="ts_55283970_55290730_" > play out. Props and costumes help the participants take risks in new roles, as do the playful atmosphere</a><a name="ts_55290730_55296830_" > and the support from the actors. In the discussion groups afterwards, students respond to questions</a><a name="ts_55296830_55303710_" > like, how is this scene similar or different from what happens in your school? How do you get the respect</a><a name="ts_55303710_55311170_" > that you need? And how do you settle your differences? These discussions become lively exchanges as many</a><a name="ts_55311170_55317870_" > students volunteer their thoughts and ideas. Our trauma center team evaluated this program</a><a name="ts_55317870_55325160_" > at two grade levels in 17 participating schools. Classrooms that participated in the UI program were</a><a name="ts_55325160_55330980_" > compared with similar non-participating classrooms. At the fourth grade level, we found a significant</a><a name="ts_55330980_55336960_" > positive response. On standardized rating scales for aggression, cooperation, and self-control,</a><a name="ts_55336960_55338016_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55338016_55344800_" > students in the UI group showed substantially fewer fights and angry outbursts, more cooperation and</a><a name="ts_55344800_55351920_" > self-assertion with peers, and more attentiveness and engagement in the classroom. Much to our</a><a name="ts_55351920_55358100_" > surprise, these results were not matched by the eighth graders. What had happened in the interim that</a><a name="ts_55358100_55364780_" > affected their responses? At first, we had only our personal impressions to go on. When I&#x27;d visit the</a><a name="ts_55364780_55370784_" > fourth grade classes, I&#x27;d be struck by their wide-eyed innocence and their eagerness to participate.</a><a name="ts_55370784_55372000_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55372000_55377460_" > The eighth graders, in contrast, were often sullen and defensive, and as a group seemed to have lost</a><a name="ts_55377460_55384910_" > their spontaneity and enthusiasm. Onset of puberty was one obvious factor for the change, but might there</a><a name="ts_55384910_55392090_" > be others? When we delved further, we found that the older children had experienced more than twice as</a><a name="ts_55392090_55398688_" > much trauma as the younger ones. Every single eighth grader in these typical American inner-city schools</a><a name="ts_55399232_55406120_" > had witnessed serious violence. Two-thirds had observed five or more incidents, including stabbings,</a><a name="ts_55406380_55413070_" > gunfights, killings, and domestic assaults. Our data showed that eighth graders with such high levels</a><a name="ts_55413070_55418590_" > of exposure to violence were significantly more aggressive than students without these histories,</a><a name="ts_55418590_55419616_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55419616_55426070_" > and that the program made no significant difference in their behavior. The Trauma Center</a><a name="ts_55426070_55431030_" > team decided to see if we could turn this situation around with a longer and more intensive program</a><a name="ts_55431030_55437830_" > that focused on team building and emotion regulation exercises, using scripts that dealt directly with</a><a name="ts_55437830_55444340_" > the kinds of violence these kids experienced. For several months, members of our staff, led by Joseph</a><a name="ts_55444340_55450610_" > Spinazzola, met weekly with the UI actors to work on script development. The actors taught our</a><a name="ts_55450610_55457230_" > psychologists improvisation, mirroring, and precise physical attunement so they could credibly</a><a name="ts_55457230_55463450_" > portray melting down, confronting, cowering, or collapsing. We taught the actors about trauma</a><a name="ts_55463450_55471450_" > triggers and how to recognize and deal with trauma reenactments. During the winter and spring of 2005,</a><a name="ts_55471890_55477640_" > we tested the resulting program at a specialized day school, run jointly by the Boston Public Schools</a><a name="ts_55477640_55484060_" > and the Massachusetts Department of Correction. This was a chaotic environment in which students</a><a name="ts_55484060_55490310_" > were often shuttled back and forth between school and jail. All of them came from high crime</a><a name="ts_55490310_55496520_" > neighborhoods and had been exposed to horrendous violence. I had never seen such an aggressive</a><a name="ts_55497040_55502910_" > and sullen group of kids. We got a glimpse into the lives of the innumerable middle school and high</a><a name="ts_55502910_55509230_" > school teachers who deal daily with students whose first response to new challenges is to lash out or go</a><a name="ts_55509230_55515910_" > into defiant withdrawal. We were shocked to discover that in scenes where someone was in physical</a><a name="ts_55515910_55523170_" > danger, the students always sided with the aggressors. Because they could not tolerate any sign of weakness</a><a name="ts_55523170_55529696_" > in themselves, they could not accept it in others. They showed nothing but contempt for potential victims,</a><a name="ts_55530304_55539240_" > yelling things like, kill the bitch, she deserves it, during a skit about dating violence. At first,</a><a name="ts_55539460_55545024_" > some of the professional actors wanted to give up. It was simply too painful to see how mean these kids were,</a><a name="ts_55545984_55550990_" > but they stuck it out. And I was amazed to see how they gradually got the students to experiment,</a><a name="ts_55551270_55558090_" > however reluctantly, with new roles. Toward the end of the program, a few students were even</a><a name="ts_55558090_55564250_" > volunteering for parts that involved showing vulnerability or fear. When they received their</a><a name="ts_55564250_55569710_" > certificate of completion, several shyly gave the actors drawings to express their appreciation.</a><a name="ts_55569710_55571168_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55571168_55579840_" > I detected a few tears, possibly even in myself. Our attempt to make trauma-drama a regular part of the</a><a name="ts_55579840_55584660_" > eighth grade curriculum in the Boston public schools, unfortunately ran into a wall of</a><a name="ts_55584660_55590360_" > bureaucratic resistance. Nonetheless, it lives on as an integral part of the residential treatment</a><a name="ts_55590360_55598470_" > programs at the Justice Resource Institute. While music, theater, art, and sports, timeless ways of</a><a name="ts_55598470_55609750_" > fostering competence and collective bonding continue to disappear from our schools. Possibility Project.</a><a name="ts_55609750_55617210_" > In Paul Griffin&#x27;s New York City Possibility Project, the actors are not presented with prepared</a><a name="ts_55617210_55623090_" > scripts. Instead, over a nine-month period, they meet for three hours a week, write their own</a><a name="ts_55623090_55628910_" > full-length musical, and perform it for several hundred people. During its 20-year history, the</a><a name="ts_55628910_55635770_" > Possibility Project has accrued to stable staff and strong traditions. Each production team is made</a><a name="ts_55635770_55642370_" > up of recent graduates who, with the help of professional actors, dancers, and musicians, organize script</a><a name="ts_55642370_55648740_" > writing, scenic design, choreography, and rehearsals for the incoming class. These recent grads are</a><a name="ts_55648740_55654070_" > powerful role models. As Paul told me, when they come into the program, students believe they</a><a name="ts_55654070_55659100_" > cannot make a difference. Putting a program like this together is a transforming experience for their</a><a name="ts_55659100_55668960_" > future. In 2010, Paul started a new program specifically for foster care youth. This is a troubled population.</a><a name="ts_55669920_55677430_" > Five years after maturing out of care, some 60% will have been convicted of a crime. 75% will be on</a><a name="ts_55677430_55684580_" > public assistance, and only 6% will have completed even a community college degree. The trauma center treats</a><a name="ts_55684580_55689760_" > many foster care kids, but Griffin gave me a new way to see their lives. He said,</a><a name="ts_55689760_55690816_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55690816_55695530_" > Understanding foster care is like learning about a foreign country. If you&#x27;re not from there,</a><a name="ts_55695610_55702530_" > you don&#x27;t speak the language. Life is upside down for foster care youth. The security and love that</a><a name="ts_55702530_55708040_" > other children take for granted, they have to create for themselves. When Griffin says,</a><a name="ts_55708620_55713230_" > life is upside down, he means that if you treat kids in foster care with love or generosity,</a><a name="ts_55714208_55719392_" > they often don&#x27;t know what to make of it, or how to respond. Rudeness feels more familiar.</a><a name="ts_55720192_55727140_" > cynicism. They understand. As Griffin points out, abandonment makes it impossible to trust,</a><a name="ts_55727320_55732210_" > and kids who have gone through foster care understand abandonment. You can have no impact</a><a name="ts_55732210_55738750_" > until they trust you. Foster care children often answer to multiple people in charge. If they want to</a><a name="ts_55738750_55744030_" > switch schools, for example, they have to deal with foster parents, school officials, the foster care</a><a name="ts_55744030_55750590_" > agency, and sometimes a judge. This tends to make them politically savvy, and they learn all too well how to play</a><a name="ts_55750590_55760032_" > people. In the foster care world, permanency is a big buzzword. The motto is, one caring adult,</a><a name="ts_55760672_55767010_" > that&#x27;s all you need. However, it&#x27;s natural for teenagers to pull away from adults, and Griffin</a><a name="ts_55767010_55773290_" > remarks that the best form of permanency for teens is a steady group of friends, which the program is</a><a name="ts_55773290_55781696_" > designed to provide. Another foster care buzzword is independence, which Paul counters with interdependence.</a><a name="ts_55781696_55782944_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_55782944_55788920_" > We&#x27;re all interdependent, he points out. The idea that we&#x27;re asking our young people to go out in</a><a name="ts_55788920_55794500_" > the world completely alone and call themselves independent is crazy. We need to teach them how</a><a name="ts_55794500_55800780_" > to be interdependent, which means teaching them how to have relationships. Paul found that foster</a><a name="ts_55800780_55807800_" > care youth are natural actors. Playing tragic characters, you have to express emotions and create a reality</a><a name="ts_55807800_55815840_" > that comes from a place of depth and sorrow and hurt. Young people in foster care, that&#x27;s all they know.</a><a name="ts_55816800_55823150_" > It&#x27;s life and death every day for them. Over time, collaboration helps the kids become important</a><a name="ts_55823150_55830160_" > people in one another&#x27;s lives. Phase one of the program is group building. The first rehearsal</a><a name="ts_55830160_55838610_" > establishes basic agreements, responsibility, accountability, and respect. Yes to expressions</a><a name="ts_55838610_55846144_" > of affection, no to sexual contact in the group. Then they begin singing and moving together,</a><a name="ts_55847008_55855424_" > which gets them in sync. Now comes phase two, sharing life stories. They are now listening to one another,</a><a name="ts_55855968_55862460_" > discovering shared experiences, breaking through the loneliness and isolation of trauma. Paul gave</a><a name="ts_55862460_55868200_" > me a film that shows how this happened in one group. When the kids are first asked to say or do</a><a name="ts_55868200_55873888_" > something to introduce themselves, they freeze, their faces expressionless, their eyes cast down, doing</a><a name="ts_55874496_55882100_" > anything they can to become invisible. As they begin to talk, as they discover a voice in which they</a><a name="ts_55882100_55888800_" > themselves are central, they also begin to create their own show. Paul makes it clear the production</a><a name="ts_55888800_55895296_" > depends on their input. If you could write a musical or play, what would you put in it?</a><a name="ts_55896000_55903616_" > Punishment? Revenge? Betrayal? Loss? This is your show to write. Everything they say is written down,</a><a name="ts_55904480_55910390_" > and some of them start to put their own words on paper. As the script emerges, the production team</a><a name="ts_55910390_55916750_" > incorporates the students precise words into the songs and dialogue. The group will learn that if</a><a name="ts_55916750_55923190_" > they can embody their experiences well enough, other people will listen. They will learn to feel what they</a><a name="ts_55923190_55931110_" > feel and know what they know. The focus changes naturally as rehearsals begin. The foster kids&#x27;</a><a name="ts_55931250_55936870_" > history of pain, alienation, and fear is no longer central. And the emphasis shifts to,</a><a name="ts_55937728_55942528_" > how can I become the best actor, singer, dancer, choreographer, or lighting and set designer I can</a><a name="ts_55943104_55950270_" > possibly be? Being able to perform becomes the critical issue. Competence is the best defense</a><a name="ts_55950270_55958848_" > against the helplessness of trauma. And this is, of course, true for all of us. When the job goes bad,</a><a name="ts_55959456_55965540_" > when a cherished project fails, when someone you count on leaves you or dies, there are few</a><a name="ts_55965540_55970496_" > things as helpful as moving your muscles and doing something that demands focused attention.</a><a name="ts_55970496_55972416_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_55972416_55977910_" > Inner city schools and psychiatric programs often lose sight of this. They want the kids to behave</a><a name="ts_55977910_55987350_" > normally without building the competencies that will make them feel normal. Theater programs also teach</a><a name="ts_55987350_55994300_" > cause and effect. A foster kid&#x27;s life is completely unpredictable. Anything can happen without notice.</a><a name="ts_55994820_55999360_" > Being triggered and having a meltdown, seeing a parent arrested or killed,</a><a name="ts_56000032_56004930_" > being moved from one home to another, getting yelled at for things that got you approval in</a><a name="ts_56004930_56010160_" > your last placement. In a theatrical production, they see the consequences of their decisions</a><a name="ts_56010160_56016440_" > and actions laid out directly before their eyes. If you want to give them a sense of control,</a><a name="ts_56016440_56017760_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56017760_56022410_" > you have to give them power over their destiny rather than intervene on their behalf, Paul explains.</a><a name="ts_56023328_56028890_" > You cannot help, fix, or save the young people you are working with. What you can do is work side by</a><a name="ts_56028890_56034610_" > side with them, help them to understand their vision, and realize it with them. By doing that,</a><a name="ts_56034610_56039776_" > you give them back control. We&#x27;re healing trauma without anyone ever mentioning the word.</a><a name="ts_56039776_56044000_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_56044000_56050050_" > Sentenced to Shakespeare. For the teenagers attending sessions of Shakespeare in the courts,</a><a name="ts_56050350_56058140_" > there is no improvisation, no building scripts around their own lives.

The emphasis is on keeping everyone safe. The kids</a><a name="ts_56120470_56128020_" > love sword play, but to keep one another safe, they have to negotiate and use language. Shakespeare was</a><a name="ts_56128020_56133020_" > writing at a time of transition, when the world was moving from primarily oral to written</a><a name="ts_56133020_56139100_" > communication, when most people were still signing their name with an X. These kids are facing their</a><a name="ts_56139100_56146030_" > own period of transition. Many are barely articulate, and some struggle to read at all. If they rely on</a><a name="ts_56146030_56150670_" > four-letter words, it&#x27;s not only to show they&#x27;re tough, but because they have no other language to</a><a name="ts_56150670_56157230_" > communicate who they are or what they feel. When they discover the richness and the potential of</a><a name="ts_56157230_56165270_" > language, they often have a visceral experience of joy. Actors first investigate what, exactly,</a><a name="ts_56165270_56172544_" > Shakespeare is saying. Line by line. The director feeds the words one by one into the actor&#x27;s ears,</a><a name="ts_56173120_56178230_" > and they are instructed to say the line on the outgoing breath. At the beginning of the process,</a><a name="ts_56178410_56184420_" > many of these kids can barely get a line out. Progress is slow, as each actor slowly internalizes</a><a name="ts_56184420_56190500_" > the words. The words gain depth and resonance as the voice changes in response to their associations.</a><a name="ts_56190500_56192288_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_56192288_56197950_" > The idea is to inspire the actors to sense their reactions to the words and soon discover the</a><a name="ts_56197950_56204510_" > character. Rather than, I have to remember my lines, the emphasis is on, what do these words</a><a name="ts_56204510_56210830_" > mean to me? What effect do I have on my fellow actors? And what happens to me when I hear their</a><a name="ts_56210830_56218010_" > lines? This can be a life-changing process. As I witnessed in a workshop run by actors trained</a><a name="ts_56218010_56224700_" > by Shakespeare and Company at the VA Medical Center in Bath, New York. Larry, a 59-year-old Vietnam veteran</a><a name="ts_56224700_56230400_" > with 27 detox hospitalizations during the previous year, had volunteered to play the role of</a><a name="ts_56230400_56236430_" > Brutus in a scene from Julius Caesar. As the rehearsal began, he mumbled and hurried through</a><a name="ts_56236430_56245530_" > his lines. He seemed to be terrified of what people were thinking of. Remember March. The Ides of March</a><a name="ts_56245530_56252460_" > remember. Did not great Julius bleed for justice&#x27;s sake? What villain touched his body that did stab and</a><a name="ts_56252460_56260500_" > not for justice? It seemed to take hours to rehearse the speech that begins with these lines. At first,</a><a name="ts_56260580_56265952_" > he was just standing there, shoulders slumped, repeating the words that the director whispered in his ear.</a><a name="ts_56265952_56267424_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56267424_56275850_" > Remember. What do you remember? Do you remember too much? Or not enough? Remember. What do you want</a><a name="ts_56275850_56283780_" > to remember? What is it like to remember? Larry&#x27;s voice cracked, eyes to the floor, sweat beating on</a><a name="ts_56283780_56292800_" > his forehead. After a short break and a sip of water, back to work. Justice. Did you receive justice? Did you</a><a name="ts_56293600_56302336_" > ever bleed for justice&#x27;s sake? What does justice mean to you? Struck. Have you ever struck someone? Have you</a><a name="ts_56302976_56312768_" > ever been struck? What was it like? What do you wish you had done? Stab. Have you ever stabbed someone? Have you</a><a name="ts_56313536_56320370_" > ever felt stabbed in the back? Have you stabbed someone in the back? At this point, Larry bolted</a><a name="ts_56320370_56327610_" > from the room. The next day he returned and we began again. Larry standing there, perspiring,</a><a name="ts_56327810_56333520_" > heart racing, having a million associations going through his mind, gradually allowing himself to</a><a name="ts_56333520_56339820_" > feel every word and learning to own the lines that he uttered. At the end of the program, Larry started</a><a name="ts_56339820_56346510_" > his first job in seven years and he was still working, the last I heard, six months later. Learning to</a><a name="ts_56346510_56353500_" > experience and tolerate deep emotions is essential for recovery from trauma. In Shakespeare and the</a><a name="ts_56353500_56359120_" > courts, the specificity of the language that is used in rehearsal extends to the student&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_56359120_56364320_" > offstage speech. Kevin Coleman notes that their talk is riddled with the expression,</a><a name="ts_56364896_56370910_" > I feel like. He goes on, if you are confusing your emotional experiences with your judgments,</a><a name="ts_56371210_56376770_" > your work becomes vague. If you ask them, how did that feel? They&#x27;ll immediately say,</a><a name="ts_56376970_56384320_" > it felt good or that felt bad. Both of those are judgments. So we never say, how did that feel?</a><a name="ts_56384320_56390390_" > at the end of a scene. Because it invites them to go to the judgment part of their brain. Instead,</a><a name="ts_56390510_56396400_" > Coleman asks, did you notice any specific feelings that came up for you doing that scene? That way,</a><a name="ts_56396460_56402910_" > they learn to name emotional experiences. I felt angry when he said that. I felt scared when he looked</a><a name="ts_56402910_56411320_" > at me. Becoming embodied and, for lack of a better word, enlanguaged, helps the actors realize that they</a><a name="ts_56411320_56418950_" > have many different emotions. The more they notice, the more curious they get. When rehearsals begin,</a><a name="ts_56418950_56423456_" > the kids have to learn to stand up straight and walk across the stage unselfconsciously.</a><a name="ts_56423456_56424672_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56424672_56428150_" > They have to learn to speak so that they can be heard in all parts of the theater,</a><a name="ts_56428450_56434230_" > which in itself presents a huge challenge. The final performance means facing the community.</a><a name="ts_56434230_56435328_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56435328_56440608_" > The kids step out onto the stage, experiencing another level of vulnerability, danger, or safety,</a><a name="ts_56441376_56446670_" > and they find out how much they can trust themselves. Gradually, the eagerness to succeed,</a><a name="ts_56446670_56447680_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56447680_56453460_" > to show that they can do it, takes over. Kevin told me the story of a girl who played</a><a name="ts_56453460_56459616_" > Ophelia in Hamlet. On the day of the performance, he saw her waiting backstage, ready to go on,</a><a name="ts_56460192_56466430_" > with a waste basket clutched to her belly. She explained that she was so nervous, she was</a><a name="ts_56466430_56471990_" > scared she&#x27;d throw up. She had been a chronic runaway from her foster homes, and also from</a><a name="ts_56471990_56477830_" > Shakespeare in the courts. Because the program is committed to not throwing kids out if at all</a><a name="ts_56477830_56483830_" > possible, the police and truant officers had repeatedly brought her back. There must have come a</a><a name="ts_56483830_56488430_" > point when she began to realize that her role was essential to the group, or perhaps she sensed the</a><a name="ts_56488430_56495360_" > intrinsic value of the experience for herself. At least for that day, she was choosing not to run.</a><a name="ts_56495360_56498784_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_56498784_56499968_" > Therapy and Theater</a><a name="ts_56499968_56501856_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_56501856_56505080_" > I once heard Tina Packer declare to a room full of trauma specialists,</a><a name="ts_56505080_56506400_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56506400_56511900_" > Therapy and theater are intuition at work. They are the opposite of research, where one strives to</a><a name="ts_56511900_56517350_" > step outside of one&#x27;s own personal experience, even outside your patient&#x27;s experience, to test the</a><a name="ts_56517350_56523490_" > objective validity of assumptions. What makes therapy effective is deep, subjective resonance,</a><a name="ts_56523490_56531020_" > and that deep sense of truth and veracity that lives in the body. I&#x27;m still hoping that someday</a><a name="ts_56531020_56536750_" > we will prove Tina wrong and combine the rigor of scientific methods with the power of embodied</a><a name="ts_56536750_56542810_" > intuition. Edward, one of the Shakespeare and Company teachers, told me about an experience</a><a name="ts_56542810_56548050_" > he&#x27;d had as a young actor in Packer&#x27;s advanced training workshop. The group had spent the morning</a><a name="ts_56548050_56553110_" > doing exercises aimed at getting the muscles of the torso to release, so that the breath could drop in</a><a name="ts_56553110_56558480_" > naturally and fully. Edward noticed that every time he rolled through one section of his ribs,</a><a name="ts_56558480_56565504_" > he&#x27;d feel a wave of sadness. The coach asked if he&#x27;d ever been injured there, and he said no.</a><a name="ts_56565504_56566720_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56566720_56571550_" > For Packer&#x27;s afternoon class, he&#x27;d prepared a speech from Richard II, where the king is summoned</a><a name="ts_56571550_56577410_" > to give up his crown to the Lord who has usurped him. During the discussion afterward,</a><a name="ts_56577650_56582160_" > he recalled that his mother had broken her ribs when she was pregnant with him, and that he&#x27;d always</a><a name="ts_56582160_56590310_" > associated this with his premature birth. As he recalled, when I told Tina this, she started asking me</a><a name="ts_56590310_56595600_" > questions about my first few months. I said I didn&#x27;t remember being in an incubator,</a><a name="ts_56595600_56601210_" > but that I remembered times later when I stopped breathing and being in the hospital in an oxygen</a><a name="ts_56601210_56607070_" > tent. I remembered being in my uncle&#x27;s car and him driving through red lights to get me to the</a><a name="ts_56607070_56614660_" > emergency room. It was like having sudden infant death syndrome at the age of three. Tina kept asking</a><a name="ts_56614660_56620520_" > me questions, and I started to get really frustrated and angry at her poking away at whatever shield I had</a><a name="ts_56620520_56629090_" > around that pain. Then she said, was it painful when the doctors stuck all those needles in you? At that moment,</a><a name="ts_56629090_56634390_" > I just started screaming. I tried to leave the room, but two of the other actors, really big guys,</a><a name="ts_56634530_56641248_" > held me down. They finally got me to sit in a chair, and I was trembling and shaking. Then Tina said,</a><a name="ts_56641248_56642528_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_56642528_56648910_" > you&#x27;re your mother, and you&#x27;re going to do this speech. You&#x27;re your mother, and you&#x27;re giving birth to</a><a name="ts_56648910_56657200_" > yourself, and you&#x27;re telling yourself that you&#x27;re going to make it. You&#x27;re not going to die. You must convince</a><a name="ts_56657200_56665700_" > yourself. You must convince that little newborn that you&#x27;re not going to die. This became my intention with</a><a name="ts_56665700_56670800_" > Richard&#x27;s speech. When I first brought the speech to class, I told myself that I wanted to get the role</a><a name="ts_56670800_56677290_" > right. Not that something welling deep inside me needed to say these words. When finally it did,</a><a name="ts_56678080_56684820_" > it became so clear that my baby was like Richard. I was not ready to give up my throne. It was like</a><a name="ts_56685660_56692230_" > megatons of energy and tension just left my body. Pathways opening up for expression that had been</a><a name="ts_56692230_56699820_" > blocked by this baby holding his breath and being so afraid that it was going to die. The genius of</a><a name="ts_56699820_56706430_" > Tina was in having me become my mother telling me you&#x27;d be okay. It was almost like going back and</a><a name="ts_56706430_56712560_" > changing the story. Being reassured that someday I would feel safe enough to express my pain made it</a><a name="ts_56712560_56719040_" > a precious part of my life. That night, I had the first orgasm I&#x27;d ever had in the presence of another</a><a name="ts_56719040_56726250_" > person. And I know it&#x27;s because I released something, some tension in my body, that allowed me to be more</a><a name="ts_56726250_56743070_" > in the world. Epilogue. Choices to be made. We are on the verge of becoming a trauma-conscious society. Almost every</a><a name="ts_56743070_56747010_" > day, one of my colleagues publishes another report on how trauma disrupts the workings of</a><a name="ts_56747010_56755232_" > mind, brain, and body.

If you have</a><a name="ts_56796850_56804730_" > come this far with me in The Body Keeps the Score, you have also become part of this community. Advances in</a><a name="ts_56804730_56809510_" > neuroscience have given us a better understanding of how trauma changes brain development, self-regulation,</a><a name="ts_56809510_56816450_" > and the capacity to stay focused and in tune with others. Sophisticated imaging techniques have</a><a name="ts_56816450_56823170_" > identified the origins of PTSD in the brain so that we now understand why traumatized people become</a><a name="ts_56823170_56830100_" > disengaged, why they are bothered by sounds and lights, and why they may blow up or withdraw in</a><a name="ts_56830100_56836210_" > response to the slightest provocation.

My colleagues and I focus much of our work</a><a name="ts_57509720_57517550_" > where trauma has its greatest impact, on children and adolescents. Since we came together to establish</a><a name="ts_57517550_57523360_" > the National Child Traumatic Stress Network in 2001, it has grown into a collaborative network of more</a><a name="ts_57523360_57530640_" > than 150 centers nationwide, each of which has created programs in schools, juvenile justice systems,</a><a name="ts_57531320_57537120_" > child welfare agencies, homeless shelters, military facilities, and residential group homes.</a><a name="ts_57537120_57546520_" > The Trauma Center is one of NCTSN&#x27;s treatment development and evaluation sites. My colleagues,</a><a name="ts_57546700_57552710_" > Joe Spinazzola, Margaret Blauston, and I have developed comprehensive programs for children and adolescents that</a><a name="ts_57552710_57559630_" > we, with the help of trauma-savvy colleagues in Hartford, Chicago, Houston, San Francisco, Anchorage,</a><a name="ts_57559830_57567490_" > Los Angeles, and New York, are now implementing. Our team selects a particular area of the country to work in</a><a name="ts_57567490_57573570_" > every two years, relying on local contacts to identify organizations that are energetic, open,</a><a name="ts_57573590_57581150_" > and well-respected. These will eventually serve as new nodes for treatment dissemination. For example,</a><a name="ts_57581430_57587870_" > I collaborated for one two-year period with colleagues in Missoula, Montana, to help develop a culturally</a><a name="ts_57587870_57595480_" > sensitive trauma program on Blackfoot Indian reservations. The greatest hope for traumatized,</a><a name="ts_57595480_57602000_" > abused, and neglected children is to receive a good education in schools where they are seen and</a><a name="ts_57602000_57609350_" > known, where they learn to regulate themselves, and where they can develop a sense of agency. At their</a><a name="ts_57609350_57615740_" > best, schools can function as islands of safety in a chaotic world. They can teach children how their</a><a name="ts_57615740_57622260_" > bodies and brains work, and how they can understand and deal with their emotions. Schools can play a</a><a name="ts_57622260_57627540_" > significant role in instilling the resilience necessary to deal with the traumas of neighborhoods or</a><a name="ts_57627540_57634250_" > families. If parents are forced to work two jobs to eke out a living, or if they are too impaired,</a><a name="ts_57634870_57641680_" > overwhelmed, or depressed to be attuned to the needs of their kids, schools by default have to be the</a><a name="ts_57641680_57649280_" > places where children are taught self-leadership and an internal locus of control. When our team arrives</a><a name="ts_57649280_57655330_" > at a school, the teacher&#x27;s initial response is often some version of, if I had wanted to be a social</a><a name="ts_57655330_57662670_" > worker, I would have gone to social work school, but I came here to be a teacher. Many of them have</a><a name="ts_57662670_57667350_" > already learned the hard way, however, that they cannot teach if they have a classroom filled with</a><a name="ts_57667350_57673590_" > students whose alarm bells are constantly going off. Even the most committed teachers and school</a><a name="ts_57673590_57680070_" > systems often come to feel frustrated and ineffective because so many of their kids are too traumatized</a><a name="ts_57680070_57686230_" > to learn. Focusing only on improving test scores won&#x27;t make any difference if teachers can&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_57686230_57692100_" > effectively address the behavior problems of these students. The good news is that the basic principles</a><a name="ts_57692100_57698240_" > of trauma-focused interventions can be translated into practical day-to-day routines and approaches that can</a><a name="ts_57698848_57706250_" > transform the entire culture of a school. Most teachers we work with are intrigued to learn</a><a name="ts_57706250_57712800_" > that abused and neglected students are likely to interpret any deviation from routine as danger and</a><a name="ts_57713696_57720470_" > that their extreme reactions usually are expressions of traumatic stress. Children who defy the rules are</a><a name="ts_57720470_57726290_" > unlikely to be brought to reason by verbal reprimands or even suspension, a practice that has become</a><a name="ts_57726290_57733200_" > epidemic in American schools. Teachers&#x27; perspectives begin to change when they realize that these kids&#x27;</a><a name="ts_57733200_57739510_" > disturbing behaviors started out as frustrated attempts to communicate distress and as misguided</a><a name="ts_57739510_57747970_" > attempts to survive. More than anything else, being able to feel safe with other people defines</a><a name="ts_57747970_57755020_" > mental health. Safe connections are fundamental to meaningful and satisfying lives. The critical challenge</a><a name="ts_57755020_57762830_" > in a classroom setting is to foster reciprocity, truly hearing and being heard, really seeing and being seen</a><a name="ts_57762830_57770040_" > by other people. We try to teach everyone in the school community, office staff, principals, bus drivers,</a><a name="ts_57770040_57775488_" > teachers, and cafeteria workers to recognize and understand the effects of trauma on children and</a><a name="ts_57776384_57784710_" > to focus on the importance of fostering safety, predictability, and being known and seen. We make</a><a name="ts_57784710_57789790_" > certain that the children are greeted by name every morning and that teachers make face-to-face contact</a><a name="ts_57789790_57797260_" > with each and every one of them. Just as in our workshops, group work, and theater programs, we always start</a><a name="ts_57797260_57804500_" > the day with check-ins, taking the time to share what&#x27;s on everybody&#x27;s mind. Many of the children we work</a><a name="ts_57804500_57809400_" > with have never been able to communicate successfully with language, as they are accustomed to adults</a><a name="ts_57809400_57818450_" > who yell, command, sulk, or put earbuds in their ears. One of our first steps is to help their teachers</a><a name="ts_57818450_57826530_" > model new ways of talking about feelings, stating expectations, and asking for help. Instead of yelling,</a><a name="ts_57826670_57833840_" > stop, when a child is throwing a tantrum, or making her sit alone in the corner, teachers are encouraged to</a><a name="ts_57833840_57841888_" > notice and name the child&#x27;s experience, as in, I can see how upset you are, to give her choices, as in,</a><a name="ts_57842464_57847480_" > would you like to go to the safe spot or sit on my lap? And help her find words to describe</a><a name="ts_57847480_57852928_" > her feelings and begin to find her voice, as in, what will happen when you get home after class?</a><a name="ts_57852928_57854656_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_57854656_57859590_" > It may take many months for a child to know when it is safe to speak the truth, because it will never</a><a name="ts_57859590_57865550_" > be universally safe. But for children, as for adults, identifying the truth of an experience</a><a name="ts_57865550_57873430_" > is essential to healing from trauma. It&#x27;s standard practice in many schools to punish children for</a><a name="ts_57873430_57880256_" > tantrums, spacing out, or aggressive outbursts, all of which are often symptoms of traumatic stress.</a><a name="ts_57880256_57881696_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_57881696_57888608_" > When that happens, the school, instead of offering a safe haven, becomes yet another traumatic trigger.</a><a name="ts_57888608_57890464_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_57890464_57895710_" > Angry confrontations and punishment can, at best, temporarily halt unacceptable behaviors.</a><a name="ts_57895710_57897024_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_57897024_57901056_" > But since the underlying alarm system and stress hormones are not laid to rest,</a><a name="ts_57901856_57908650_" > they are certain to erupt again at the next provocation. In such situations,</a><a name="ts_57908830_57913952_" > the first step is acknowledging that a child is upset. Then, the teacher should calm him,</a><a name="ts_57914592_57921700_" > then explore the cause, and discuss possible solutions. For example, when a first grader melts down,</a><a name="ts_57921700_57927350_" > hitting his teacher and throwing objects around, we encourage his teacher to set clear limits while</a><a name="ts_57927350_57932608_" > gently talking to him. Would you like to wrap that blanket around you to help you calm down?</a><a name="ts_57933600_57939072_" > The kid is likely to scream no, but then curl up under the blanket and settle down.</a><a name="ts_57939072_57940480_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_57940480_57947890_" > Predictability and clarity of expectations are critical. Consistency is essential. Children from</a><a name="ts_57947890_57955100_" > chaotic backgrounds often have no idea how people can effectively work together. And inconsistency only</a><a name="ts_57955100_57960350_" > promotes further confusion. Trauma-sensitive teachers soon realize that calling a parent</a><a name="ts_57960350_57969430_" > about an obstreperous kid is likely to result in a beating and further traumatization. Our goal in all</a><a name="ts_57969430_57976250_" > these efforts is to translate brain science into everyday practice. For example, calming down enough to</a><a name="ts_57976250_57981632_" > take charge of ourselves requires activating the brain areas that notice our inner sensations. The</a><a name="ts_57982560_57989330_" > self-observing watchtower discussed in Chapter 4. So, a teacher might say, shall we take some deep</a><a name="ts_57989330_57996370_" > breaths or use the breathing star? This is a colorful breathing aid made out of file folders. Another</a><a name="ts_57996370_58000810_" > option might be having the child sit in a corner wrapped in a heavy blanket while listening to some</a><a name="ts_58000810_58008170_" > soothing music through headphones.

Looking into a mirror helps kids to be aware of what they look</a><a name="ts_58113060_58120650_" > like when they are sad, angry, bored, or disappointed. Then we ask them, how do you feel when you see a face</a><a name="ts_58120650_58128400_" > like that? We teach them how their brains are built, what emotions are for, and where they are registered</a><a name="ts_58128400_58135200_" > in their bodies, and how they can communicate their feelings to the people around them. They learn that</a><a name="ts_58135200_58139960_" > their facial muscles give clues about what they are feeling, and then experiment with how their facial</a><a name="ts_58139960_58147270_" > expressions affect other people. We also strengthen the brain&#x27;s watchtower by teaching them to recognize</a><a name="ts_58147270_58154600_" > and name their physical sensations. For example, when their chest tightens, that probably means that</a><a name="ts_58154600_58161888_" > they are nervous, their breathing becomes shallow, and they feel uptight. What does anger feel like,</a><a name="ts_58162592_58168390_" > and what can they do to change that sensation in their body? What happens if they take a deep breath, or</a><a name="ts_58168390_58177030_" > take time out to jump rope, or hit a punching bag? Does tapping acupressure points help? We try to provide</a><a name="ts_58177030_58182310_" > children, teachers, and other care providers with a toolbox of ways to take charge of their emotional</a><a name="ts_58182310_58190530_" > reactions. To promote reciprocity, we use other mirroring exercises, which are the foundation of</a><a name="ts_58190530_58196960_" > safe, interpersonal communication. Kids practice imitating one another&#x27;s facial expressions. They</a><a name="ts_58197824_58205830_" > proceed to imitating gestures and sounds, and then get up and move in sync. To play well, they have to</a><a name="ts_58205830_58213320_" > pay attention to really seeing and hearing one another. Games like Simon Says lead to lots of</a><a name="ts_58213320_58221580_" > sniggering and giggling, signs of safety and relaxation. When teenagers balk at these stupid</a><a name="ts_58221580_58228580_" > games, we nod, understandingly, and enlist their cooperation by asking them to demonstrate games</a><a name="ts_58228580_58234760_" > to the little kids who need their help. Teachers and leaders learn that an activity as simple as</a><a name="ts_58234760_58240720_" > trying to keep a beach ball in the air as long as possible helps groups become more focused, cohesive,</a><a name="ts_58240760_58248710_" > and fun.

Many of us remember</a><a name="ts_58279130_58285490_" > what playing team sports, singing in the school choir, or playing in the marching band meant to us,</a><a name="ts_58285790_58291910_" > especially if we had coaches or directors who believed in us, pushing us to excel and taught us</a><a name="ts_58291910_58298048_" > that we could be better than we thought was possible.

The scene</a><a name="ts_58357390_58363200_" > came to life only after the bully talked about his father&#x27;s violence and his own vow never to show</a><a name="ts_58363200_58369430_" > weakness to anyone. Most bullies have themselves been bullied, and they despise kids who remind them</a><a name="ts_58369430_58376830_" > of their own vulnerability. Brutus&#x27; powerful voice, on the other hand, emerged after he realized</a><a name="ts_58376830_58383800_" > that he&#x27;d made himself invisible to deal with his own family violence. These intense communal efforts</a><a name="ts_58383800_58391130_" > force kids to collaborate, compromise, and stay focused on the task at hand. Tensions often run high,</a><a name="ts_58391290_58395750_" > but the kids stick with it because they want to earn the respect of their coaches or directors,</a><a name="ts_58396110_58401240_" > and don&#x27;t want to let down the team. All feelings that are opposite to the vulnerability of being</a><a name="ts_58401240_58408800_" > subjected to arbitrary abuse, the invisibility of neglect, and the godforsaken isolation of trauma.</a><a name="ts_58408800_58412736_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_58412736_58418590_" > Our NCTSN programs are working. Kids become less anxious and emotionally reactive,</a><a name="ts_58418590_58424510_" > and are less aggressive or withdrawn.

Most great instigators of social change have</a><a name="ts_58507150_58513610_" > intimate personal knowledge of trauma. Oprah Winfrey comes to mind, as do Maya Angelou,</a><a name="ts_58513610_58520260_" > Nelson Mandela, and Elie Wiesel.
