name="ts_5030_5470_S01" > they do.</a><a name="ts_5730_10630_S01" > Some have experienced trauma or a huge stressor, but a surprising amount of them say something</a><a name="ts_10630_12530_S01" > like, everything in my life is fine.</a><a name="ts_12530_16928_S01" > I have no reason to be depressed, but I just don&#x27;t feel happy anymore.</a><a name="ts_17568_18490_S01" > So here&#x27;s my theory.</a><a name="ts_19050_25690_S01" > Depression happens when tiny things, often unnoticed, add up over time and become overwhelming.</a><a name="ts_25930_30870_S01" > Researchers have explored the brain&#x27;s giving up circuit, which flips from, this is hard,</a><a name="ts_30870_35130_S01" > but I&#x27;m gonna keep trying, to, this is pointless, I&#x27;m gonna give up.</a><a name="ts_35270_40130_S01" > And when life feels too overwhelming, the nervous system reinforces shutdown and hopelessness.</a><a name="ts_40290_44850_S01" > Now this is actually great news because if we can just manage just a few of these tiny</a><a name="ts_44850_50290_S01" > things, we can remove some of the weight fueling our depression, allowing our brain and body&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_50290_52210_S01" > natural resilience to kick back in.</a><a name="ts_52330_57664_S01" > So let&#x27;s take a look at the micro habits that add up over time to cause depression.</a><a name="ts_57664_60992_S01" > (...)</a><a name="ts_60992_62640_S01" > Depression isn&#x27;t just about feeling sad.</a><a name="ts_62640_64940_S01" > It&#x27;s actually not being able to feel much happiness.</a><a name="ts_65220_66400_S01" > Where does this come from?</a><a name="ts_66740_71680_S01" > Usually someone who&#x27;s been depressed has been hurt so many times that it&#x27;s easier to expect</a><a name="ts_71680_74740_S01" > the worst than to hope for the best and be disappointed.</a><a name="ts_74980_78920_S01" > Over time this warps into downplaying anything good that happens.</a><a name="ts_78940_81680_S01" > It can look like dismissing wins.</a><a name="ts_81800_85780_S01" > So sure, I got out of bed and I went to work, but anyone could do that.</a><a name="ts_85780_88640_S01" > Or it can look like rejecting compliments.</a><a name="ts_88640_90340_S01" > Oh, they&#x27;re just being nice.</a><a name="ts_90520_92320_S01" > Or downplaying the positive.</a><a name="ts_92540_96180_S01" > Oh, I got a raise, but with inflation it doesn&#x27;t matter.</a><a name="ts_96640_99780_S01" > Or discounting something beautiful like, oh, what a pretty sunset.</a><a name="ts_100220_102320_S01" > Probably just pollution, right?</a><a name="ts_102720_107520_S01" > Dismissing the positive is an attempt to prevent hurt, to numb, to avoid feeling, instead of to</a><a name="ts_107520_109940_S01" > feel both joy and sadness.</a><a name="ts_109940_113980_S01" > And I think that a lot of people who develop depression are these beautiful sensitive souls</a><a name="ts_113980_119260_S01" > who feel every emotion so deeply that they subconsciously start to numb themselves because</a><a name="ts_119260_121580_S01" > they don&#x27;t know what to do with the pain of the world.</a><a name="ts_121940_126220_S01" > By constantly rejecting positivity, we train our brain to ignore the good and focus only on</a><a name="ts_126220_126620_S01" > the negative.</a><a name="ts_126880_132020_S01" > You&#x27;re trying to protect yourself from hurt, but you&#x27;re fueling depression in the long run.</a><a name="ts_132020_135740_S01" > Okay, let&#x27;s talk about another micro habit that fuels depression.</a><a name="ts_136160_138820_S01" > How do you treat yourself when you&#x27;ve made a mistake?</a><a name="ts_138820_140096_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_140096_142890_S01" > Do you berate yourself for not being perfect?</a><a name="ts_143150_147950_S01" > Do you say things like, I&#x27;m such an idiot, I&#x27;m such a loser, what&#x27;s the matter with me?</a><a name="ts_148250_149130_S01" > This is a reflex.</a><a name="ts_149270_152330_S01" > Maybe you even think that it&#x27;s helpful, like if you yell at yourself enough,</a><a name="ts_152690_154410_S01" > then you&#x27;ll be motivated to be better.</a><a name="ts_154570_156832_S01" > And I would say, how&#x27;s that working for you?</a><a name="ts_157472_158630_S01" > Usually this backfires.</a><a name="ts_158830_162950_S01" > Many people believe that self-criticism motivates improvement,</a><a name="ts_162950_165950_S01" > but research shows it actually fuels shame and inaction.</a><a name="ts_166110_171650_S01" > The problem is when you experience pain, you respond in a way that fuels more pain</a><a name="ts_171650_173710_S01" > instead of healing and self-compassion.</a><a name="ts_173950_175150_S01" > Okay, next one.</a><a name="ts_175230_180150_S01" > Another really common way that we accidentally fuel depression is how we respond to our feelings.</a><a name="ts_180450_186410_S01" > People with depression often have a subconscious habit of blaming yourself for having emotions.</a><a name="ts_186550_189170_S01" > So for example, you say, oh, I feel guilty for being depressed.</a><a name="ts_189170_191150_S01" > I&#x27;m weak for having anxiety.</a><a name="ts_191230_192970_S01" > I should just get over this.</a><a name="ts_193150_197430_S01" > These judgy thoughts pile extra negativity on normal emotions,</a><a name="ts_197450_200350_S01" > making them harder to process in a healthy way.</a><a name="ts_200450_203710_S01" > And if you do this over and over, eventually it&#x27;s going to add up,</a><a name="ts_203730_207630_S01" > and your little shutdown circuit is going to flip the switch to depression.</a><a name="ts_207950_212170_S01" > Okay, depression often brings a habit of withdrawing from life.</a><a name="ts_212170_214090_S01" > So you switch from connection to withdrawal.</a><a name="ts_214090_217670_S01" > The brain thinks, if I just avoid difficult situations, I won&#x27;t get hurt.</a><a name="ts_217810_221610_S01" > And over time, this avoidance fuels loneliness and isolation.</a><a name="ts_221770_226030_S01" > It might look like avoiding opportunities, like, oh, why enter the art competition if I might not win?</a><a name="ts_226410_227790_S01" > Or canceling plans.</a><a name="ts_227790_229490_S01" > They wouldn&#x27;t want to see me if I&#x27;m feeling down.</a><a name="ts_229850_231170_S01" > Or not reaching out.</a><a name="ts_231270_233390_S01" > Oh, if they cared, they&#x27;d message me first.</a><a name="ts_233830_238930_S01" > If you repeat this pattern over and over again, you get stuck in a cycle of withdrawing and feeling worse.</a><a name="ts_239450_241630_S01" > So when you feel bad, you withdraw more.</a><a name="ts_241770_246048_S01" > And it&#x27;s just this tiny habit that fuels a cycle that&#x27;s hard to get out of.</a><a name="ts_246656_248010_S01" > Okay, here&#x27;s the next habit.</a><a name="ts_248450_249310_S01" > Numbing behaviors.</a><a name="ts_250030_253090_S01" > Bottling up emotions is our parents&#x27; generational coping skill.</a><a name="ts_253530_255630_S01" > They might have said things like, no one wants to hear it.</a><a name="ts_255710_257290_S01" > Put on your big girl panties.</a><a name="ts_257630_262150_S01" > I heard one guy describe this as just shoving all your emotions into a mental trash can,</a><a name="ts_262190_264070_S01" > but then you have to carry that around.</a><a name="ts_264590_267710_S01" > So instead of dealing with emotions, do you turn to distractions?</a><a name="ts_267710_270910_S01" > Like, oh, if you&#x27;re feeling stressed, do you eat something to feel better?</a><a name="ts_271290_274390_S01" > Or if you&#x27;re feeling tired, hurt, or overwhelmed, do you look at your phone?</a><a name="ts_275050_277910_S01" > If you have a stressful problem, do you avoid it?</a><a name="ts_278110_278470_S01" > Right?</a><a name="ts_278710_283550_S01" > If you feel like you&#x27;re never good enough, do you become a workaholic to suppress those feelings?</a><a name="ts_284430_291250_S01" > People with depression often get trapped in a cycle of trying not to feel bad or trying to feel happy,</a><a name="ts_291270_296190_S01" > and research shows that this has much poorer outcomes than learning to work through problems.</a><a name="ts_296190_300790_S01" > When we were kids and didn&#x27;t have the skills to solve a problem, our parents may have responded</a><a name="ts_300790_304490_S01" > to our emotions by distracting us with a show or giving us a snack.</a><a name="ts_304730_307610_S01" > Essentially, just more of these numbing behaviors.</a><a name="ts_307850_312890_S01" > But now that we&#x27;re adults, we can learn the skills to face our problems and to build up the skills to</a><a name="ts_312890_314528_S01" > solve them instead of avoiding them.</a><a name="ts_315392_320680_S01" > Okay, and the opposite side of numbing is rumination.</a><a name="ts_320680_325780_S01" > This is overthinking the past. This is where you&#x27;re replaying mistakes, dwelling on injustices,</a><a name="ts_325920_331300_S01" > you&#x27;re spiraling about what could have been. All of this fuels depression. The brain mistakes this</a><a name="ts_331300_335540_S01" > for problem solving, and that&#x27;s why it keeps doing it, but it actually keeps you stuck.</a><a name="ts_335540_337472_S01" > (..)</a><a name="ts_337472_340830_S01" > The next one&#x27;s super common, and I&#x27;m going to let Tim Ferriss introduce it.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_340930_345290_S00" >S00: For me, generally, low mood, if we want to call it depression, it&#x27;s not a first cause.</a><a name="ts_345290_350270_S00" > It&#x27;s typically some type of anxious rumination, worrying about something. I compromise my sleep</a><a name="ts_350270_354450_S00" > because I have onset insomnia. Then I consume too much caffeine, which further compromises my sleep.</a><a name="ts_354650_359030_S00" > And then after three or four days, that&#x27;s when the low mood slash depressive symptoms show up.</a><a name="ts_359130_361130_S00" > So anything that compromises sleep, I try to avoid.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_361270_364570_S01" >S01: Okay, who&#x27;s this guy? Tim Ferriss is the bestselling author of multiple books,</a><a name="ts_364650_368630_S01" > the host of a super popular podcast. He&#x27;s a multimillionaire, and he also struggles</a><a name="ts_368630_373430_S01" > with depression and low mood at times. Failing to take care of basic needs like sleep,</a><a name="ts_373430_378650_S01" > healthy eating, and stress management worsens depression. A lot of people don&#x27;t even recognize</a><a name="ts_378650_383190_S01" > their stress levels until they hit a breaking point. I interviewed an ER doctor last year,</a><a name="ts_383230_388170_S01" > and she said that often when someone comes in having a panic attack, they think they&#x27;re having a heart</a><a name="ts_388170_393270_S01" > attack. But then when she asks them if they&#x27;re stressed out, they say no. Then she asks them about</a><a name="ts_393270_398790_S01" > their lives, and they&#x27;ve got mountains of stress that they didn&#x27;t even realize. School pressure, work</a><a name="ts_398790_402990_S01" > demands, relationship problems, unresolved trauma, money problems, they&#x27;re all piling up on them.</a><a name="ts_402990_408510_S01" > We&#x27;re pretty good at suppressing and not noticing these things, but they do catch up to you over</a><a name="ts_408510_412750_S01" > time, and this can fuel depression. So it&#x27;s important to take care of your basic needs,</a><a name="ts_412750_418048_S01" > like sleep and exercise, to offset what chronic stress does to your body and mind.</a><a name="ts_418624_424630_S01" > Okay, here&#x27;s another one. Waiting for motivation. Waiting until you feel motivated to take action,</a><a name="ts_424690_430350_S01" > as in, ooh, I&#x27;ll wait till I feel like it before I get out of bed, or I&#x27;ll wait till I&#x27;m happy to leave the</a><a name="ts_430350_435690_S01" > house or see friends. It&#x27;s pretty clear to see how this can backfire, but it&#x27;s also an easy trap to</a><a name="ts_435690_441450_S01" > get stuck in. Motivation follows action. You have to act first. It&#x27;s not the other way around.</a><a name="ts_442110_446570_S01" > Behavioral activation, which is one of the most effective treatments for depression, works by</a><a name="ts_446570_453510_S01" > encouraging you to take small steps even when you don&#x27;t feel like it. Okay, another micro habit that</a><a name="ts_453510_459030_S01" > fuels depression is emotional reasoning. This is believing that your feelings mean something.</a><a name="ts_459230_465290_S01" > It can sound like, if I feel sad, my life must be pointless. If I feel anxious, I must be an awkward</a><a name="ts_465290_471980_S01" > person. If I feel lonely, I must be unlovable. Feelings aren&#x27;t facts. Learning to separate emotions</a><a name="ts_471980_480100_S01" > from reality is key to shifting out of depressive thinking. Okay, there&#x27;s also the classic depression</a><a name="ts_480100_484900_S01" > fueling thinking pattern, all or nothing thinking. Depression just thrives on all or nothing thinking.</a><a name="ts_485120_491040_S01" > If I can&#x27;t do a full workout, why bother at all? If I messed up at work, I should just quit. If one</a><a name="ts_491040_497500_S01" > person rejects me, no one loves me. Recognizing and challenging these thoughts can help break the cycle.</a><a name="ts_497500_503560_S01" > Usually, any small action is better than a perfect action. If you don&#x27;t have the time for a full</a><a name="ts_503560_509340_S01" > workout, put on your sneakers and go for a short walk. Okay, I have two more for you. They are both</a><a name="ts_509340_516940_S01" > about your mindset. We&#x27;ve got a victim mindset and a nothing-will-change mindset, a fixed mindset.</a><a name="ts_517180_522960_S01" > So what do you do when adversity strikes? What do you do if you get fired from your job?</a><a name="ts_523680_527520_S01" > Or if you get in a fight with your spouse, what&#x27;s your reflexive thought pattern?</a><a name="ts_527520_532000_S01" > There&#x27;s a lot more toxic thinking patterns that fuel depression. When you&#x27;re thinking these,</a><a name="ts_532160_536020_S01" > you don&#x27;t really notice it. It just feels like reality. So a victim mindset says,</a><a name="ts_536300_540940_S01" > life is so unfair. Poor me. I can&#x27;t do anything about it because of all these things that have</a><a name="ts_540940_546280_S01" > happened. There&#x27;s a difference between having been victimized and a victim mindset. A victim mindset,</a><a name="ts_546280_552100_S01" > you&#x27;ll notice, it always comes up when you&#x27;re asked to make a change or take some action. I can&#x27;t because...</a><a name="ts_552100_557420_S01" > that is very different from saying, this thing happened to me. Okay, fixed mindset is believing</a><a name="ts_557420_562040_S01" > that how you feel is permanent and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about that. You want to replace that with</a><a name="ts_562040_566740_S01" > a growth mindset. You want to ask yourself, what could I learn? What skills could I learn to make</a><a name="ts_566740_571040_S01" > things better? I haven&#x27;t figured out how to overcome my depression yet. I bet there&#x27;s something out there</a><a name="ts_571040_579580_S01" > that&#x27;s going to help me. Okay, so can you see how heavy these micro habits get and how when several</a><a name="ts_579580_584160_S01" > of these habits are part of your life, they can flip that switch to depression? Okay, so why did I just</a><a name="ts_584160_589080_S01" > make a huge list of things that might be fueling your depression? Well, when you can recognize them,</a><a name="ts_589120_595960_S01" > you can change them. Each of these habits are tiny. They&#x27;re micro responses to the experiences we have in life.</a><a name="ts_596500_601860_S01" > Did you mess up? Are you going to handle that by catastrophizing and thinking it&#x27;s pointless?</a><a name="ts_602260_608150_S01" > Or will you be gentle with yourself and try again? Are you feeling really lonely? Are you going to judge</a><a name="ts_608150_612850_S01" > yourself as broken and withdraw from people? Or are you going to look for opportunities to remember the</a><a name="ts_612850_621952_S01" > good time with friends and reach out to them? Taking some action even before you feel like it, right?</a><a name="ts_621952_623330_S01" > (.)</a><a name="ts_623330_629310_S01" > These micro habits make the difference between depression and resilience. Because when you&#x27;re able to see them</a><a name="ts_629310_635190_S01" > and know what they are, and you start chipping away at them one at a time, the balance of your nervous</a><a name="ts_635190_642432_S01" > system can literally shift from being overwhelmed, shut down, and numbed, to feeling on top of life,</a><a name="ts_643008_649550_S01" > more alive, and more motivated. Just pick one area to work on, and little by little, your life can improve</a><a name="ts_649550_656990_S01" > in really big ways. Okay, so what&#x27;s one thing from this list that you want to work on? Leave a comment below,</a><a name="ts_656990_660870_S01" > check out my Change Your Brain course if you&#x27;d like to learn more, because I teach these tiny,</a><a name="ts_661610_665910_S01" > research-backed daily habits to improve mental health. The link&#x27;s in the description. It&#x27;s helped</a><a name="ts_665910_671264_S01" > tens of thousands of people, and I&#x27;m sure it can help you too. Thank you so much for watching, and take care.</a></p></div></body>
