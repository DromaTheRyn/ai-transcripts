> A lot of people do.</a><a name="ts_5370_6370_" > Let me show you something interesting.</a><a name="ts_7110_10090_" > Researchers studying how depression shows up in the brain</a><a name="ts_10090_14790_" > found that there is a physical gap in the brain</a><a name="ts_14790_16510_" > that contributes to this problem,</a><a name="ts_16510_18270_" > and I&#x27;m gonna come back to that in a few minutes.</a><a name="ts_18310_20930_" > But first, let&#x27;s do a little exercise</a><a name="ts_20930_22150_" > that will help demonstrate</a><a name="ts_22670_24910_" > why we might

is the father of the spoon.</a><a name="ts_40320_44370_" > Now, I get that this might not make sense right away,</a><a name="ts_44490_46290_" > but I really want you to figure this out.</a><a name="ts_47168_50120_" > Why is the fork the father of the spoon?</a><a name="ts_50700_51840_" > Okay, and this is important,</a><a name="ts_51840_56550_" > so please pause the video and write in the comments below</a><a name="ts_57010_61810_" > why you think the fork could be the father of the spoon.</a><a name="ts_61810_64790_" > Now, this is important to understand how your brain works.</a><a name="ts_64890_66048_" > We&#x27;re gonna analyze your answer.</a><a name="ts_66048_71328_" > (.....)</a><a name="ts_71328_72290_" > Okay, thanks for hanging with me.</a><a name="ts_72390_76290_" > Okay, so the fork is not actually the father of the spoon.</a><a name="ts_76370_78650_" > A fork is a fork, and it did not father anything.</a><a name="ts_78830_80570_" > But if you read the comments below,</a><a name="ts_80610_82490_" > you&#x27;ll see that lots of people&#x27;s brains</a><a name="ts_82490_84510_" > came up with some kind of connection.</a><a name="ts_84790_88290_" > Their brain took two ideas and found a way to connect them.</a><a name="ts_88290_90870_" > Your mind is a meaning-making machine.</a><a name="ts_90870_93230_" > It&#x27;s constantly taking pieces of information,</a><a name="ts_93230_96330_" > and it&#x27;s seeking to figure out connections between them.</a><a name="ts_96490_98710_" > So, for example, someone doesn&#x27;t text you back.</a><a name="ts_98830_101090_" > Your mind creates a story about why.</a><a name="ts_101330_102570_" > A door slams.</a><a name="ts_102950_106110_" > Your brain is instantly generating possible explanations.</a><a name="ts_106450_108370_" > The only fact is that the door slammed.</a><a name="ts_108550_111370_" > Everything else is meaning that your mind has created,</a><a name="ts_111390_115950_" > just like it may have invented some reason why the fork is the father of the spoon.</a><a name="ts_115950_118410_" > This is one of the things that happens with depression.</a><a name="ts_118830_122130_" > So, if you&#x27;re feeling really sad, that&#x27;s objective.</a><a name="ts_122610_123790_" > But then the mind asks,</a><a name="ts_123970_125410_" > Why do I feel sad?</a><a name="ts_125730_127090_" > I must have caused this.</a><a name="ts_127170_129070_" > What have I done to make myself feel this way?</a><a name="ts_129210_133090_" > And then the mind makes up those reasons to fill in the blank.</a><a name="ts_133410_134270_" > It might think,</a><a name="ts_134430_136192_" > Hmm, it must be because I&#x27;m lazy.</a><a name="ts_136768_137830_" > There&#x27;s something wrong with me.</a><a name="ts_137970_140270_" > If I had more willpower, I wouldn&#x27;t feel this way.</a><a name="ts_140450_141910_" > Your brain takes two ideas,</a><a name="ts_142010_144250_" > I feel sad and I must have caused it,</a><a name="ts_144250_147690_" > And it&#x27;s invented all of these reasons to fill in the blank.</a><a name="ts_147910_151424_" > Your brain tells you a story and it feels really real.</a><a name="ts_152096_156420_" > Self-blame is one of the sneakiest ways that depression distorts your view of reality.</a><a name="ts_156540_159320_" > And in this video, you&#x27;re going to learn to see the lie for what it is</a><a name="ts_159320_161632_" > and how to replace it with something healthier.</a><a name="ts_161632_165344_" > (....)</a><a name="ts_165344_168690_" > Okay, depression creates a cycle that&#x27;s difficult to escape.</a><a name="ts_168870_170250_" > So you feel depressed,</a><a name="ts_170290_172250_" > then you blame yourself for feeling this way.</a><a name="ts_172290_174130_" > I&#x27;m so stupid for being depressed.</a><a name="ts_174130_176890_" > Then you feel worse because of that self-blame.</a><a name="ts_176990_181670_" > And then, because your only response to feeling worse is to beat yourself up,</a><a name="ts_181770_183670_" > you start to criticize yourself even more.</a><a name="ts_183790_184930_" > You might say,</a><a name="ts_185010_186290_" > I&#x27;m such a loser.</a><a name="ts_186790_188990_" > And then that&#x27;s going to make you feel even more terrible.</a><a name="ts_188990_190830_" > And then you continue punishing yourself.</a><a name="ts_191430_198090_" > In this cycle, every life disappointment or every emotion becomes interpreted as being deserved</a><a name="ts_198610_200850_" > punishment for your perceived badness.</a><a name="ts_200850_202530_" > You think you deserve to be punished.</a><a name="ts_202930_206730_" > Depression twists your thinking so thoroughly that you even get depressed about being depressed.</a><a name="ts_206970_211950_" > The only tool you have in response to feelings is to blame or to punish yourself.</a><a name="ts_212390_216490_" > So even if you get feeling better, you might feel guilty or uncomfortable about feeling better.</a><a name="ts_216530_219670_" > You might think, I don&#x27;t deserve it, or it&#x27;ll never last.</a><a name="ts_219850_222610_" > This is self-sabotage at its finest.</a><a name="ts_223010_228530_" > Not only do you blame and punish yourself, but you believe you deserve it because of who you are.</a><a name="ts_228530_231810_" > That there&#x27;s something about your identity that&#x27;s broken.</a><a name="ts_231890_235950_" > So when random or uncontrollable things happen, it&#x27;s all my fault.</a><a name="ts_236230_238730_" > These are meanings that your mind is inventing.</a><a name="ts_238830_240590_" > And then you feel bad and then you think,</a><a name="ts_240630_243210_" > Oh, if I were a better person, I wouldn&#x27;t be feeling this way.</a><a name="ts_243310_246670_" > The more you blame yourself, the worse you feel, creating a downward spiral.</a><a name="ts_247030_250140_" > So where does this tendency to blame ourselves come from?</a><a name="ts_250140_251260_" > Why do we do it?</a><a name="ts_251620_253640_" > There&#x27;s a couple of things that could be going on here.</a><a name="ts_253920_255020_" > One is family dynamics.</a><a name="ts_255020_257100_" > Maybe you learned this pattern from your family.</a><a name="ts_257280_261840_" > If your parents didn&#x27;t know how to handle their own emotions when they were sad or angry or hurt,</a><a name="ts_261920_266400_" > they might have punished you for expressing feelings that made them uncomfortable.</a><a name="ts_266840_268040_" > So you might have heard something like,</a><a name="ts_268060_269700_" > Stop crying. You&#x27;re fine.</a><a name="ts_270280_273700_" > Which teaches children that certain emotions are unacceptable.</a><a name="ts_274528_276690_" > Okay? And then you might punish yourself for having those feelings.</a><a name="ts_276690_277984_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_277984_279120_" > Second one is cultural factors.</a><a name="ts_279160_282480_" > A lot of cultures emphasize personal responsibility and willpower.</a><a name="ts_282480_287400_" > This leads to belief that depression is something that a person should just be able to snap out of.</a><a name="ts_287920_292520_" > Messages like, Oh, just choose to be happy or be grateful for what you have</a><a name="ts_292520_298752_" > are easily twisted into more reasons why you&#x27;re bad for not being able to do so.</a><a name="ts_299744_298752_" > All right.</a><a name="ts_298752_299970_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_299970_301050_" > Another one is social pressure.</a><a name="ts_301490_304350_" > Society often labels emotional expression as weakness.</a><a name="ts_304830_307030_" > You might have heard, Don&#x27;t be a crybaby.</a><a name="ts_307450_308850_" > And others have it worse.</a><a name="ts_308850_314048_" > And these reinforce the idea that struggling with emotions indicates personal failure.</a><a name="ts_314688_314950_" > Okay?</a><a name="ts_315270_316850_" > Another one, false comparisons.</a><a name="ts_317110_320870_" > Seeing other people who appear to be handling life better leads to comparisons.</a><a name="ts_321070_322010_" > Ah, they can do it.</a><a name="ts_322070_322730_" > They&#x27;re so happy.</a><a name="ts_322810_323590_" > Their life&#x27;s so perfect.</a><a name="ts_323830_325070_" > Why can&#x27;t I?</a><a name="ts_325330_325570_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_325630_331930_" > This ignores the fact that everyone faces different circumstances and has different internal and external resources.</a><a name="ts_332410_332850_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_333070_337190_" > Lastly, there&#x27;s another big reason why we might blame ourselves for feeling depressed.</a><a name="ts_337830_340630_" > It&#x27;s actually kind of self-protective.</a><a name="ts_340750_342150_" > So let me ask you this question.</a><a name="ts_342530_345888_" > Does blaming yourself help you in any way?</a><a name="ts_346560_348310_" > Does it serve some kind of function?</a><a name="ts_348770_351750_" > Like, even if the benefits don&#x27;t last, even if it punishes you later,</a><a name="ts_351890_355570_" > the brain only repeats things that are rewarding in some way.</a><a name="ts_355990_361856_" > What are you getting out of blaming yourself or labeling yourself as broken?</a><a name="ts_361856_363072_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_363072_364840_" > I think there&#x27;s a couple things that could be going on here.</a><a name="ts_365560_366920_" > One is an illusion of control.</a><a name="ts_367060_368840_" > Blaming yourself gives you a sense of agency.</a><a name="ts_368840_372440_" > If it&#x27;s your fault, then you have some control over the situation.</a><a name="ts_372680_378000_" > It can feel better, strangely, to believe that I&#x27;m the problem</a><a name="ts_378000_383100_" > than to acknowledge that some aspects of depression or your happiness might be beyond your control.</a><a name="ts_383500_383820_" > Okay?</a><a name="ts_384100_385940_" > Number two, it&#x27;s self-protective.</a><a name="ts_386080_391140_" > If you label yourself as broken, doesn&#x27;t that feel just a little vindicating?</a><a name="ts_391140_395780_" > Like, if I&#x27;m broken, at least I can excuse myself for not putting in more effort.</a><a name="ts_396080_399540_" > Number three, it might protect you from the danger of blaming someone else,</a><a name="ts_399540_403540_" > or it might protect you from feeling angry at someone who mistreats you,</a><a name="ts_403540_407200_" > or at someone who provides for you, like a parent.</a><a name="ts_407200_411420_" > If you internalize that hatred, then you can avoid conflict.</a><a name="ts_411500_415480_" > So your parent does something, it hurts you, you feel angry, you can&#x27;t say it,</a><a name="ts_415560_420140_" > so you say, well, man, I must be bad because I&#x27;m feeling this way.</a><a name="ts_420160_422272_" > And then you internalize that anger.</a><a name="ts_422880_428010_" > Okay, lastly, sometimes self-blame can draw sympathy or support from others.</a><a name="ts_428992_431590_" > Now, one of the reasons we know that self-blame serves a function,</a><a name="ts_431590_434430_" > but not like a lasting healthy function, but a function anyway,</a><a name="ts_434430_439530_" > is because when therapists or friends try to convince someone that it&#x27;s not their fault,</a><a name="ts_439790_442910_" > people with depression often resist those suggestions.</a><a name="ts_442910_445410_" > So when friends try to cheer them up, they might think,</a><a name="ts_445470_450970_" > oh, anyone who really knew me could not possibly say such positive things.</a><a name="ts_451270_455050_" > Or how dare you be optimistic when there&#x27;s no hope?</a><a name="ts_455190_460890_" > Blaming yourself can form a heavy sort of armor, one that you&#x27;re reluctant to let go of.</a><a name="ts_461170_463950_" > Maybe you&#x27;ve hurt so much that you&#x27;ve just shifted into protective mode.</a><a name="ts_463950_468530_" > If you let yourself feel happy, then it&#x27;ll just hurt more when the sadness returns.</a><a name="ts_468530_472510_" > So you push away any signs that you might be a worthwhile human being,</a><a name="ts_472510_476800_" > and this is an attempt to protect yourself from future pain.</a><a name="ts_477568_479390_" > Okay, depression is a big fat liar.</a><a name="ts_479590_482630_" > It&#x27;s gonna tell you that you&#x27;re a terrible human being for feeling depressed,</a><a name="ts_482670_484410_" > that you&#x27;re weak, that you should be ashamed,</a><a name="ts_484410_488090_" > and that blaming yourself is the correct response.</a><a name="ts_488090_490530_" > It&#x27;s the appropriate way to handle those feelings.</a><a name="ts_490570_492510_" > But depression is a type of blindness.</a><a name="ts_492510_496512_" > You simply cannot see things clearly when you&#x27;re depressed.</a><a name="ts_496512_497728_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_497728_501590_" > And unlike a broken leg, depression doesn&#x27;t always have a visible cause.</a><a name="ts_501810_507470_" > Without something external to blame, the mind desperately searches for a connection,</a><a name="ts_507470_508510_" > and people turn inward.</a><a name="ts_508510_510510_" > They assume they must be the problem.</a><a name="ts_510690_513170_" > In the words of Aaron Beck, this is irrational thinking.</a><a name="ts_513170_515650_" > But to a depressed person, it feels rational.</a><a name="ts_515650_516990_" > It seems to make sense.</a><a name="ts_517110_518390_" > But it&#x27;s not rational.</a><a name="ts_518390_523890_" > Believing that it&#x27;s your fault is actually a defining symptom of depression in the DSM.</a><a name="ts_524630_527250_" > Excessive self-blame is right here.</a><a name="ts_527630_531230_" > People with depression are much more likely to feel excessive guilt,</a><a name="ts_531370_533630_" > guilt that does not make sense to an outsider.</a><a name="ts_533750_537090_" > You&#x27;ll feel like it&#x27;s your fault that you&#x27;re lonely, that you struggle to get out of bed.</a><a name="ts_537090_540110_" > You&#x27;ll berate yourself for feeling sad, for feeling unmotivated,</a><a name="ts_540170_543710_" > for not having perfect relationships, for being abused, for being sensitive.</a><a name="ts_543710_546980_" > And all this guilt makes you even more depressed.</a><a name="ts_546980_549140_" > And then you blame yourself for being depressed too.</a><a name="ts_549720_552880_" > Okay, there&#x27;s actually research showing that people with depression</a><a name="ts_552880_558360_" > have fewer physical connections in brain areas that help regulate self-blame.</a><a name="ts_558480_563120_" > There&#x27;s a disconnect between the part of the brain that overgeneralizes</a><a name="ts_563120_565060_" > and the part that thinks about oneself.</a><a name="ts_565420_570600_" > This gap means that when you feel bad about one thing, you blame yourself for everything.</a><a name="ts_570680_573920_" > When you make one mistake, you feel like a complete failure.</a><a name="ts_573920_576020_" > And interestingly, I think this is fascinating.</a><a name="ts_576160_580440_" > In brain studies, the blame and guilt centers did not activate,</a><a name="ts_580580_583900_" > they did not light up on the scans when other people did something wrong,</a><a name="ts_583900_587900_" > only when a depressed person perceived that they had made a mistake.</a><a name="ts_588100_593540_" > Now the good news is that your brain is especially good at rewiring itself in this area,</a><a name="ts_593540_595968_" > and we&#x27;ll talk about some ways to do that later in the video.</a><a name="ts_596960_599090_" > We just have to touch on this a little bit longer.</a><a name="ts_599270_601070_" > Depression warps your perspective.</a><a name="ts_601070_608570_" > It makes neutral things feel negative, positive things feel neutral, and negative things feel awful.</a><a name="ts_608910_613970_" > Research shows that people with depression have a bias in the way their brain processes information.</a><a name="ts_614310_617510_" > One study had people read a list of words and try to remember them.</a><a name="ts_617710_622330_" > The people with depression remembered fewer positive words than negative words.</a><a name="ts_622510_627350_" > Depression skews your memory so that you&#x27;re more likely to remember the negative stuff, like,</a><a name="ts_627350_632590_" > oh, that one time I said something hurtful, instead of the ten times you were kind and grateful.</a><a name="ts_632930_638310_" > Now this distorted thinking can lead to feelings of self-blame, rumination, and catastrophizing,</a><a name="ts_638310_640470_" > and all of that fuels depression.</a><a name="ts_641150_646590_" > Depression blinds you to reality, and it creates this filter through which all information passes.</a><a name="ts_646850_648290_" > Oh, someone else messed up?</a><a name="ts_648510_649570_" > I&#x27;m gonna ignore that.</a><a name="ts_649690_650990_" > I made a tiny mistake.</a><a name="ts_651110_654390_" > I am gonna dwell on that, remember that, ruminate on that, think about that,</a><a name="ts_654390_656768_" > blame myself for that, and feel really terrible about it.</a><a name="ts_657472_662850_" > Okay, and just real quick, I teach how to work through cognitive distortions to create more space</a><a name="ts_662850_667170_" > between you and your thoughts, and how to live a healthier, happier life in my membership.</a><a name="ts_667390_674090_" > Right now it&#x27;s only $27 a month, and you get all ten of my courses, plus a live weekly Q&amp;A with me,</a><a name="ts_674090_680390_" > and these courses will help you learn to manage crises, break free of survival mode, and finally get out of</a><a name="ts_680390_685690_" > coping and learn to actually process emotions and resolve them so that you can live the rich and</a><a name="ts_685690_686550_" > meaningful life you care about.</a><a name="ts_686630_688530_" > Okay, I&#x27;ll make sure and put the link in the description.</a><a name="ts_688730_693390_" > Okay, so to summarize, one of the core symptoms of depression is excessive self-blame.</a><a name="ts_693570_698690_" > It may come from how people treat you, how you treat yourself, or a defense mechanism.</a><a name="ts_698690_702690_" > It also can be contributed to by changes in the brain when you&#x27;re depressed.</a><a name="ts_702830_706790_" > It&#x27;s not your fault, but there is a lot you can do about it.</a><a name="ts_706790_709650_" > brains are made to rewire themselves.</a><a name="ts_710130_711750_" > So how do we do it?</a><a name="ts_712190_715150_" > First, trying to force yourself to feel happy usually backfires.</a><a name="ts_715530_719110_" > Beating yourself up for being depressed only makes things worse.</a><a name="ts_719230_724030_" > You need to set down the hammer of self-criticism and use some different tools, okay?</a><a name="ts_724190_729390_" > So people with depression often arrive there by trying extremely hard with the wrong techniques.</a><a name="ts_729570_732990_" > Maybe they&#x27;re trying to care for everyone else, maybe they&#x27;re suppressing their feelings,</a><a name="ts_732990_736390_" > or they&#x27;re protecting themselves in ways that ultimately cause self-harm.</a><a name="ts_736590_739810_" > But you don&#x27;t feel this way because you&#x27;re weak or defective.</a><a name="ts_739870_744950_" > It&#x27;s just because you lack the skills to respond to hurt or disappointment in a healthy way.</a><a name="ts_745190_748250_" > And you can learn new ways to respond to your thoughts and feelings,</a><a name="ts_748250_751610_" > and the brain&#x27;s remarkably flexible and it can be rewired.</a><a name="ts_751810_757930_" > So instead of spending all this energy blaming yourself or your body or the universe for depression,</a><a name="ts_757930_761600_" > you can take action to change depression&#x27;s brain choice.</a><a name="ts_761600_763488_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_763488_765570_" > Okay, so how are we going to do this?</a><a name="ts_765670_768950_" > First thing I would say is, like, let&#x27;s see if we can take a broader view.</a><a name="ts_769090_771190_" > So depression is going to make your view very narrow,</a><a name="ts_771190_774150_" > and it&#x27;s going to limit a lot of the things you&#x27;re willing to see and believe.</a><a name="ts_774870_776910_" > So if we take a broader view, we might say,</a><a name="ts_776950_781230_" > well, what are all the factors here that may have contributed to your feeling depressed?</a><a name="ts_781570_784850_" > Maybe it&#x27;s things like trauma or a physical illness</a><a name="ts_784850_789550_" > or brain differences or lack of support or high levels of stress or lack of resources or grief</a><a name="ts_789550_790890_" > or loss or physical exhaustion.</a><a name="ts_791030_795150_" > Plus there&#x27;s biological factors that we still know very little about.</a><a name="ts_795350_797770_" > All of these things can contribute to depression.</a><a name="ts_798230_800890_" > You cannot blame yourself for all of these things.</a><a name="ts_801170_805230_" > Now, I&#x27;ve seen some techniques that encourage people to shift the blame from themselves to others.</a><a name="ts_805230_807310_" > Like, oh, you should blame your parents for being depressed,</a><a name="ts_807310_810410_" > or you should blame brain chemistry for being depressed.</a><a name="ts_810410_816950_" > And the reality is we don&#x27;t actually know what&#x27;s causing your individual depression,</a><a name="ts_816950_819610_" > but we do know the factors that help you come out of it.</a><a name="ts_819710_823170_" > So blame is just not a helpful long-term strategy.</a><a name="ts_823270_828270_" > So instead of judgment, can you learn to sit with your thoughts and feelings</a><a name="ts_828270_830370_" > without judging yourself for having them?</a><a name="ts_830530_833920_" > And that&#x27;s how we&#x27;re going to kind of get rid of some of these filters.</a><a name="ts_834360_837160_" > And I would recommend that you practice mindfulness or willingness.</a><a name="ts_837160_838500_" > I&#x27;ve got a bunch of videos on that.</a><a name="ts_838500_843904_" > Those can be helpful ways to create some space for you to have those feelings without judging them.</a><a name="ts_844832_848370_" > Okay, speaking of judgment, people with depression often have blind spots</a><a name="ts_848370_850610_" > when trying to figure out why something happened.</a><a name="ts_850610_854790_" > They&#x27;re more likely to falsely blame themselves while excusing others&#x27; behaviors.</a><a name="ts_855070_858110_" > So here&#x27;s the second thing to try.</a><a name="ts_858370_862510_" > Practice putting your thoughts in perspective by asking yourself these questions.</a><a name="ts_862950_867770_" > If a stranger observed what happened, would they blame me entirely?</a><a name="ts_867770_872830_" > Why not? Okay, here&#x27;s another question.</a><a name="ts_872910_875010_" > If a friend had this experience and blamed themselves,</a><a name="ts_875490_877152_" > would I, what would I say to them?</a><a name="ts_877824_879200_" > Is that how you&#x27;re talking to yourself?</a><a name="ts_879808_882850_" > And then if there&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve done wrong, you might ask,</a><a name="ts_882910_885910_" > are there other explanations for this event that I&#x27;ve missed or discounted?</a><a name="ts_886230_887830_" > And then another thing you can ask is like,</a><a name="ts_887890_889890_" > oh, if I did make a mistake, if I was to blame,</a><a name="ts_889970_893170_" > what were my intentions? Do I always behave in this way?</a><a name="ts_893570_896750_" > You can use some of these questions to practice some self-compassion.</a><a name="ts_896750_901810_" > So blame rarely solves problems, but self-compassion can give us the hope</a><a name="ts_902430_904730_" > to face our problems in a healthier way.</a><a name="ts_904850_907930_" > So instead of saying, like, I&#x27;m weak, you could try saying,</a><a name="ts_908090_908992_" > I&#x27;m having a hard time, right?</a><a name="ts_909696_912110_" > Just be a little bit more compassionate toward yourself.</a><a name="ts_912310_914110_" > Be descriptive instead of judgmental.</a><a name="ts_914350_917070_" > Okay, third thing that might help is called diffusion.</a><a name="ts_917430_920170_" > It&#x27;s where you create space between yourself and your thoughts.</a><a name="ts_920190_923250_" > And this is probably easier to practice with a therapist</a><a name="ts_923250_925850_" > or maybe a really wise, supportive friend.</a><a name="ts_925990_927330_" > So when you have a thought like,</a><a name="ts_927410_928890_" > I&#x27;m so weak for being depressed,</a><a name="ts_929290_931030_" > try rephrasing it like this.</a><a name="ts_931310_935310_" > I&#x27;m having the thought that I&#x27;m so weak for being depressed.</a><a name="ts_935670_936530_" > Or even better,</a><a name="ts_936650_939990_" > I&#x27;m noticing that I&#x27;m having the thought that I&#x27;m weak for being depressed.</a><a name="ts_940130_941850_" > You do not have to argue with your mind.</a><a name="ts_941850_944010_" > You can just say, thank you, brain, for that thought.</a><a name="ts_944570_946590_" > You can challenge self-blame by asking,</a><a name="ts_946690_947810_" > would I say this to a friend?</a><a name="ts_947990_949810_" > If not, it&#x27;s probably distorted.</a><a name="ts_949810_953750_" > You could catch your brain distorting reality and lying to you.</a><a name="ts_953830_956570_" > So instead of asking like, oh, is this thought true?</a><a name="ts_956770_959150_" > Because your depressed mind is going to give you a distorted answer.</a><a name="ts_959210_961410_" > It&#x27;s a lot better to ask this question.</a><a name="ts_961730_963330_" > Is this thought helpful?</a><a name="ts_963750_966990_" > Has blaming yourself helped you take healthy action</a><a name="ts_966990_968960_" > or overcome depression?</a><a name="ts_969536_971910_" > Okay, so these are a few ways we can create some space.</a><a name="ts_972010_973590_" > We notice our thoughts.</a><a name="ts_973590_975570_" > We ask, would I say this to a friend?</a><a name="ts_975690_978590_" > And then you ask, is this thought helpful?</a><a name="ts_978590_980030_" > Does this thought help me get better?</a><a name="ts_980170_981790_" > Does this thought help me be less depressed?</a><a name="ts_982270_984670_" > Then just notice it and be like, if it&#x27;s not helpful, be like, cool,</a><a name="ts_984830_987616_" > that thought can be there, but I&#x27;m going to focus on something more helpful.</a><a name="ts_988512_990780_" > Okay, here&#x27;s another approach that I think can be helpful.</a><a name="ts_990940_993860_" > When you feel like you need to blame yourself,</a><a name="ts_993880_996560_" > a lot of people who blame themselves feel like it&#x27;s the right thing to do.</a><a name="ts_996740_999240_" > They feel like it&#x27;s justice and it&#x27;s what they deserve.</a><a name="ts_999760_1002180_" > So you could ask yourself if you feel that way,</a><a name="ts_1002300_1003680_" > what are the pros and cons?</a><a name="ts_1003920_1005860_" > What are the pros of blaming yourself?</a><a name="ts_1005860_1009260_" > So you might say, well, if I blame myself,</a><a name="ts_1009260_1011880_" > then it makes me feel like I can do something about it.</a><a name="ts_1012280_1016200_" > But a con would be, ah, blaming myself makes me feel more guilty,</a><a name="ts_1016200_1018180_" > more worthless, and more depressed.</a><a name="ts_1018180_1019520_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1019520_1022410_" > So you could just create a little space from those thoughts by being like,</a><a name="ts_1022490_1023670_" > huh, is this helping me?</a><a name="ts_1024190_1026990_" > Your mind generates countless potential thoughts.</a><a name="ts_1027150_1029450_" > And so you might scan your mind and be like, huh,</a><a name="ts_1029510_1031430_" > I wonder if there&#x27;s any other thoughts that might be more helpful.</a><a name="ts_1031430_1036350_" > And then you can choose to focus on the helpful ones while letting the unhelpful ones just like,</a><a name="ts_1036750_1038592_" > pass on by, leaves on a stream.</a><a name="ts_1038592_1039680_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1039680_1042730_" > Okay, number four, take one action.</a><a name="ts_1043010_1048096_" > So instead of blame, which usually leads to us doing less and less,</a><a name="ts_1048704_1050420_" > take accountability for progress.</a><a name="ts_1050620_1054960_" > So you could say like, oh, are my actions fueling depression or health?</a><a name="ts_1055320_1059100_" > It&#x27;s not your fault that you&#x27;re depressed, but there&#x27;s probably something you can do about it.</a><a name="ts_1059100_1062440_" > You could spend all day blaming yourself for failing at school,</a><a name="ts_1062440_1065140_" > or you could find a tutor, or you could do some studying.</a><a name="ts_1066080_1069280_" > Action is usually a lot more productive than wallowing in self-blame.</a><a name="ts_1069900_1073980_" > Now, while it&#x27;s best if the action addresses the problem you&#x27;re facing, like,</a><a name="ts_1074080_1075600_" > oh, if you&#x27;re having a problem in your relationship,</a><a name="ts_1075940_1079900_" > learn some skills to improve relationships or to communicate better, right?</a><a name="ts_1080500_1084880_" > If you can&#x27;t take action on the problem, any positive action is better than none.</a><a name="ts_1085040_1088460_" > So this might look like clean one small area, go for a walk, reach out to a friend,</a><a name="ts_1088460_1089260_" > write in a journal.</a><a name="ts_1089620_1095460_" > Any type of activation, even small actions, can interrupt the cycle of self-blame</a><a name="ts_1095460_1097800_" > and create momentum toward positive change.</a><a name="ts_1098080_1100580_" > All right, number five, get some support.</a><a name="ts_1101080_1107340_" > Therapy, the community, going to a support group, all of this can help build up your resources</a><a name="ts_1107340_1109300_" > that can help you shift your perspective.</a><a name="ts_1109300_1111680_" > So when we&#x27;re stuck in our own distorted thinking,</a><a name="ts_1111860_1114800_" > everything we think of can be filtered through that self-blaming lens.</a><a name="ts_1115300_1117960_" > Working with a therapist can help us see things a bit more clearly</a><a name="ts_1117960_1120800_" > and develop more effective strategies for managing depression.</a><a name="ts_1121536_1125000_" > Okay, so you&#x27;ve been using all of your energy to punish yourself</a><a name="ts_1125000_1127008_" > instead of to help yourself.</a><a name="ts_1127584_1128770_" > Let&#x27;s try something new.</a><a name="ts_1129110_1130290_" > Let&#x27;s break the cycle.</a><a name="ts_1130390_1132370_" > You cannot cast out darkness with darkness.</a><a name="ts_1132770_1133910_" > Only light can do that.</a><a name="ts_1133970_1135350_" > You can&#x27;t cast out hate with hate.</a><a name="ts_1135490_1136330_" > Only love can do that.</a><a name="ts_1136510_1138950_" > You cannot cast out depression with blame.</a><a name="ts_1139450_1140250_" > It just doesn&#x27;t work.</a><a name="ts_1140750_1142250_" > Instead, you can build a new habit</a><a name="ts_1142250_1145376_" > where you create a little bit of space from your thoughts.</a><a name="ts_1145952_1148288_" > You say, oh man, my brain is inventing stuff again.</a><a name="ts_1148864_1151610_" > You check your thoughts and say, which of these thoughts are helpful?</a><a name="ts_1151930_1155488_" > And then you take an action that lines up with a healthier life.</a><a name="ts_1156192_1161952_" > You can gradually rewire your brain and break free from the cycle of self-blame and depression.</a><a name="ts_1162816_1164736_" > Okay, thank you for being here and take care.</a><a name="ts_1165504_1168150_" > Hey, real quick, if you found any part of this video helpful,</a><a name="ts_1168210_1170510_" > I would really appreciate it if you give it a thumbs up</a><a name="ts_1170510_1173430_" > or share it with someone who could benefit from it today.</a><a name="ts_1173430_1174590_" > I really appreciate it.</a><a name="ts_1174690_1176094_" > Thank you so much and take care.</a></p></div></body>
