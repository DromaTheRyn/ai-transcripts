I do good things.</a><a name="ts_233090_234830_S00" > The passenger will probably remind you,</a><a name="ts_234950_235310_S00" > Oh, yeah?</a><a name="ts_235490_237790_S00" > What about how you screwed up that thing at work yesterday?</a><a name="ts_238350_239264_S00" > And guess what?</a><a name="ts_239840_243020_S00" > You&#x27;re now sucked into a power struggle with your own mind.</a><a name="ts_243020_247580_S00" > The more you fight the thought, the more power it has to hold you back.</a><a name="ts_247720_253840_S00" > When we fight our thoughts, we usually lose track of where we were going in the first place.</a><a name="ts_253840_256920_S00" > When we spend a lot of time trying to argue with our thoughts,</a><a name="ts_257120_261120_S00" > then it generally doesn&#x27;t help us live that rich, meaningful,</a><a name="ts_261380_265680_S00" > purposeful life that we&#x27;re trying to work towards with our day-to-day actions.</a><a name="ts_265820_266340_S00" > Okay?</a><a name="ts_266580_270600_S00" > So fighting with thoughts is just as harmful as listening to them.</a><a name="ts_270600_271640_S00" > Oh, gosh.</a><a name="ts_272040_276480_S00" > Okay, so you might wonder, like, but what if my thoughts are dangerous, right?</a><a name="ts_276740_280500_S00" > Just like with this bus, like, what if the passengers attack me if I don&#x27;t listen to them?</a><a name="ts_280940_282560_S00" > Shouldn&#x27;t I force them off the bus?</a><a name="ts_283264_285370_S00" > Okay, this is where we often stall out with intrusive thoughts.</a><a name="ts_285470_288470_S00" > They seem so frightening that we get stuck trying to control them,</a><a name="ts_288470_290350_S00" > or even worse, we get stuck avoiding them, okay?</a><a name="ts_290730_292110_S00" > So intrusive thoughts like,</a><a name="ts_292310_294790_S00" > Oh my gosh, what if my partner doesn&#x27;t love me?</a><a name="ts_294930_296410_S00" > This is terrifying to me.</a><a name="ts_296410_299070_S00" > Like, I have to check with them over and over and over again.</a><a name="ts_299490_301110_S00" > Or you might have an intrusive thought like,</a><a name="ts_301150_301970_S00" > What if I hurt my baby?</a><a name="ts_302150_305350_S00" > This is a really common intrusive thought that comes after moms have babies.</a><a name="ts_305910_309170_S00" > Now, the truth is, unlike actual passengers in a bus,</a><a name="ts_309330_311744_S00" > our thoughts cannot hurt us.</a><a name="ts_312384_314830_S00" > So the goal of this exercise is to help us build up the skills</a><a name="ts_314830_317470_S00" > to notice the thoughts and just say,</a><a name="ts_317650_320130_S00" > Thank you, brain, for coming up with another thought.</a><a name="ts_320330_322230_S00" > That one&#x27;s not helpful, right?</a><a name="ts_322230_324450_S00" > So in acceptance and commitment therapy, this is called diffusion.</a><a name="ts_324730_327670_S00" > Getting unstuck from thoughts instead of fighting them.</a><a name="ts_328090_330870_S00" > Trying to get rid of uncomfortable thoughts or feelings often leads to us</a><a name="ts_330870_334290_S00" > spinning our wheels, getting distracted, getting out of our driver&#x27;s seat,</a><a name="ts_334410_335890_S00" > and getting quite stuck.</a><a name="ts_336250_338410_S00" > So Sarah, for example, with the social anxiety,</a><a name="ts_338550_343490_S00" > Sarah would spend a lot of time trying to force herself to feel confident.</a><a name="ts_343630_344710_S00" > Yeah, I have to be confident.</a><a name="ts_344810_346310_S00" > Well, what if I&#x27;m not confident enough?</a><a name="ts_346550_347390_S00" > Well, I&#x27;m fine.</a><a name="ts_347450_347690_S00" > I&#x27;m fine.</a><a name="ts_347810_348230_S00" > It&#x27;ll be great.</a><a name="ts_348390_349270_S00" > Everyone&#x27;s gonna like me.</a><a name="ts_349310_350350_S00" > But what about Bob?</a><a name="ts_350350_351950_S00" > I&#x27;m not sure he likes you, right?</a><a name="ts_352150_356070_S00" > She tried to force herself to think and feel confident before going to the party.</a><a name="ts_356170_360010_S00" > And if she couldn&#x27;t change her thinking, which sometimes happened,</a><a name="ts_360430_362208_S00" > she wouldn&#x27;t go to the party.</a><a name="ts_362848_365990_S00" > Now, if you&#x27;re busy arguing with your thoughts or debating with your thoughts</a><a name="ts_365990_369050_S00" > or listening to your thoughts, you might stop making decisions.</a><a name="ts_369330_370710_S00" > You might avoid risks.</a><a name="ts_370730_375050_S00" > You might withdraw from relationships or just give up on the things that matter to you</a><a name="ts_375050_376570_S00" > to keep the passengers quiet.</a><a name="ts_376610_376950_S00" > So they&#x27;re like,</a><a name="ts_377010_377930_S00" > Hey, don&#x27;t go that way.</a><a name="ts_378070_378890_S00" > That might be dangerous.</a><a name="ts_379110_380210_S00" > You&#x27;re going the wrong direction.</a><a name="ts_380210_381710_S00" > What if something bad happens?</a><a name="ts_381850_383950_S00" > And you&#x27;re like, fine, I&#x27;m going to park my bus.</a><a name="ts_384070_386090_S00" > I&#x27;m going to stop going the way I wanted to go.</a><a name="ts_386270_391590_S00" > I&#x27;m just going to look at Netflix all day and try not to be bothered by my thoughts.</a><a name="ts_391630_391870_S00" > Right?</a><a name="ts_392270_395530_S00" > But by doing that, you&#x27;re letting those intrusive thoughts or negative thoughts</a><a name="ts_395530_397170_S00" > decide what you do with your life.</a><a name="ts_397310_400790_S00" > You&#x27;re no longer able to pay attention to where you want your bus to go</a><a name="ts_400790_404550_S00" > because you&#x27;re so wrapped up in trying to make the passengers be quiet</a><a name="ts_404550_406450_S00" > or to try to convince them to change.</a><a name="ts_406450_410750_S00" > We&#x27;re going to stick with this exercise because with practice, you&#x27;re going to learn that the</a><a name="ts_410750_414330_S00" > passengers, thoughts and emotions, they can&#x27;t actually hurt you.</a><a name="ts_414630_417216_S00" > They just can get really loud at times.</a><a name="ts_417792_417216_S00" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_417792_424660_S00" > So instead of stopping the bus to argue with the passengers or pulling over so that they don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_424660_426820_S00" > yell at you, we&#x27;re going to take a different approach.</a><a name="ts_427120_431140_S00" > Instead of fighting the passengers, fighting our thoughts, trying to control them,</a><a name="ts_432080_436200_S00" > what if rather than trying to kick them off or arguing, you just acknowledge their presence</a><a name="ts_436200_438176_S00" > and you keep driving anyway.</a><a name="ts_438720_438176_S00" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_438720_440770_S00" > So this doesn&#x27;t mean that you like the thoughts.</a><a name="ts_440910_442690_S00" > It doesn&#x27;t mean that you agree with them.</a><a name="ts_442810_446730_S00" > It just means that you recognize that they don&#x27;t have to stop you.</a><a name="ts_446990_449530_S00" > So when a self-doubt passenger pipes up with,</a><a name="ts_449630_451584_S00" > I don&#x27;t think you can pull this off.</a><a name="ts_452288_456230_S00" > You would say, thanks for your input, but I&#x27;m still driving toward what matters to me.</a><a name="ts_456370_457950_S00" > What if your husband doesn&#x27;t love you?</a><a name="ts_458848_459220_S00" > You know what?</a><a name="ts_459240_461640_S00" > I&#x27;m just going to keep investing in my relationship.</a><a name="ts_461780_465480_S00" > Thanks for popping up, brain, but I don&#x27;t need to listen to you.</a><a name="ts_465480_468704_S00" > Okay, some of these passengers might always be on your bus.</a><a name="ts_469248_469580_S00" > That&#x27;s okay.</a><a name="ts_469740_472320_S00" > You don&#x27;t need them to leave before you can move forward.</a><a name="ts_472560_474220_S00" > The goal isn&#x27;t to get rid of them.</a><a name="ts_474340_476220_S00" > It&#x27;s to drive toward your values.</a><a name="ts_476280_477880_S00" > And that&#x27;s where a lot of times we get distracted.</a><a name="ts_477960_480460_S00" > You have to pull the bus over, stop going where you want to go,</a><a name="ts_480540_482140_S00" > and spend all your energy trying to get rid of them.</a><a name="ts_482240_483400_S00" > Or you can choose, you know what?</a><a name="ts_483400_486540_S00" > I&#x27;m just going to keep working toward building up my relationships, right?</a><a name="ts_486540_487680_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_487680_491160_S00" > So here&#x27;s how you can use this metaphor in your own life</a><a name="ts_491160_493740_S00" > to manage intrusive thoughts, negative thoughts,</a><a name="ts_493740_496120_S00" > really loud, overthinking thoughts, right?</a><a name="ts_497020_499240_S00" > Step number one, identify your passengers.</a><a name="ts_499380_502360_S00" > So take a minute, if you&#x27;re struggling with negative or intrusive thoughts,</a><a name="ts_502420_505700_S00" > take a moment to write down some of the thoughts, emotions,</a><a name="ts_505700_508000_S00" > or memories that tend to show up and derail you.</a><a name="ts_508864_509470_S00" > What do they say?</a><a name="ts_509550_511070_S00" > What do they try to convince you of?</a><a name="ts_511190_512290_S00" > They might say things like,</a><a name="ts_512350_514770_S00" > no one likes you, you&#x27;re never good enough,</a><a name="ts_515270_517792_S00" > you shouldn&#x27;t try, you might fail, right?</a><a name="ts_518400_522130_S00" > Okay, step two, we&#x27;re going to name and externalize the passengers.</a><a name="ts_522130_525370_S00" > So we&#x27;re going to give each of these types of thoughts a name,</a><a name="ts_525370_531370_S00" > like, hey, you&#x27;re the worrywart, and this one is the criticizer, right?</a><a name="ts_531470_535210_S00" > And you externalize them, and by doing that, by giving them a name,</a><a name="ts_535230_537950_S00" > this can help you see that these thoughts aren&#x27;t you.</a><a name="ts_538150_539650_S00" > You are not your thoughts.</a><a name="ts_539830_541650_S00" > They&#x27;re just passengers on the bus.</a><a name="ts_541810_547010_S00" > So I often am like, oh, hey, there&#x27;s my perfectionist mind speaking up again.</a><a name="ts_547010_550752_S00" > You&#x27;re sure loud today, but I don&#x27;t have to listen to you, okay?</a><a name="ts_550752_552180_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_552180_554380_S00" > Step three, you&#x27;re going to acknowledge that they&#x27;re there,</a><a name="ts_554440_555980_S00" > but you don&#x27;t have to engage with them.</a><a name="ts_556000_557940_S00" > So when these thoughts show up, you can practice saying,</a><a name="ts_558120_560100_S00" > I hear you, but I&#x27;m still driving.</a><a name="ts_560300_562740_S00" > You notice them, but you don&#x27;t argue with them.</a><a name="ts_563040_567000_S00" > Honestly, this is a skill, like, the physical skill of driving while people say stuff is, like,</a><a name="ts_567000_570080_S00" > how you, like, actually get anywhere in a car as a parent.</a><a name="ts_570200_571980_S00" > You&#x27;re like, okay, my kids are saying all kinds of things,</a><a name="ts_571980_573920_S00" > I&#x27;m just going to focus on, like, driving.</a><a name="ts_573960_576060_S00" > When your thoughts are really persistent,</a><a name="ts_576360_578980_S00" > you can imagine creating a little bit of space from them</a><a name="ts_578980_581080_S00" > by imagining them sitting in the back of the bus,</a><a name="ts_581120_582620_S00" > rather than shouting from the front.</a><a name="ts_582960_586180_S00" > Or you could just try, like, speaking to your thoughts</a><a name="ts_586180_589040_S00" > by saying something like, wow, self-doubt.</a><a name="ts_589300_591060_S00" > Like, you&#x27;re really loud today.</a><a name="ts_591440_593260_S00" > Looks like you need to go to the back of the bus.</a><a name="ts_593360_595920_S00" > But even if they don&#x27;t listen to you, it doesn&#x27;t matter,</a><a name="ts_595940_598040_S00" > because you&#x27;re driving the bus.</a><a name="ts_598380_600200_S00" > Over time, as you move toward your values,</a><a name="ts_600200_602820_S00" > you&#x27;ll probably find that some passengers quiet down,</a><a name="ts_602820_606040_S00" > or that you simply don&#x27;t pay as much attention to them.</a><a name="ts_606400_607820_S00" > Step four, this is the most important part,</a><a name="ts_607960_609620_S00" > you keep your hands on the wheel, right?</a><a name="ts_609740_612540_S00" > You remind yourself where you want to go.</a><a name="ts_612800_614260_S00" > What do you actually care about?</a><a name="ts_614300_615000_S00" > What are your values?</a><a name="ts_615140_616460_S00" > What kind of life do you want to create?</a><a name="ts_616820_618560_S00" > Values are not the same as a destination,</a><a name="ts_618580_621100_S00" > so destination might be, like, an actual concrete goal,</a><a name="ts_621120_622180_S00" > like, I want to get married.</a><a name="ts_622400_624620_S00" > But the value is, like, I value connection.</a><a name="ts_624620_625680_S00" > I value closeness.</a><a name="ts_625760_627060_S00" > I value commitment, right?</a><a name="ts_627936_629970_S00" > So, for example, I value speaking up for my beliefs.</a><a name="ts_629970_631550_S00" > I value serving and loving others.</a><a name="ts_631670_632410_S00" > I value hard work.</a><a name="ts_632590_635670_S00" > Values are about knowing what direction you&#x27;re going in.</a><a name="ts_635830_637390_S00" > I am traveling north.</a><a name="ts_637750_639130_S00" > Now, sometimes people wonder,</a><a name="ts_639230_642610_S00" > but what if I still have intrusive thoughts when I&#x27;m traveling north?</a><a name="ts_642710_645090_S00" > What if the passengers keep yelling at me to turn around?</a><a name="ts_645190_647950_S00" > What if my thoughts keep questioning my abilities?</a><a name="ts_648410_649510_S00" > Shouldn&#x27;t they be quieter?</a><a name="ts_649770_650470_S00" > Here&#x27;s my answer.</a><a name="ts_650650_651550_S00" > They don&#x27;t matter.</a><a name="ts_651830_653050_S00" > They&#x27;re not the ones driving.</a><a name="ts_653610_656350_S00" > Thoughts may seem to threaten you or others,</a><a name="ts_656350_659010_S00" > but as you practice diffusion,</a><a name="ts_659030_661610_S00" > as you practice this act skill of noticing your thoughts</a><a name="ts_661610_664010_S00" > without listening to them or believing them or fighting with them,</a><a name="ts_664130_666310_S00" > you&#x27;ll learn that thoughts can&#x27;t actually hurt you.</a><a name="ts_666530_669870_S00" > When you focus your energy and attention on what you can control,</a><a name="ts_670050_672010_S00" > they just won&#x27;t matter as much.</a><a name="ts_672230_673984_S00" > They&#x27;ll probably quiet down.</a><a name="ts_674784_676950_S00" > So no matter how loud the thoughts get,</a><a name="ts_677610_681888_S00" > you keep driving in the direction that aligns with your goals.</a><a name="ts_682560_683260_S00" > Okay, so back to Sarah.</a><a name="ts_683360_684960_S00" > One day Sarah decides to handle things differently.</a><a name="ts_684960_687440_S00" > She reminds herself, I&#x27;m the driver of this bus.</a><a name="ts_687660_689940_S00" > My values, not my fears, decide where to go.</a><a name="ts_690120_691880_S00" > Her value is connection.</a><a name="ts_692040_694100_S00" > And that means showing up even if it&#x27;s uncomfortable.</a><a name="ts_694340_698580_S00" > So she goes to the party and the anxious passengers are still there.</a><a name="ts_698680_700580_S00" > They whisper, you&#x27;re saying the wrong thing.</a><a name="ts_700880_701540_S00" > Just leave.</a><a name="ts_702496_704990_S00" > But instead of arguing or trying to push them off,</a><a name="ts_705570_706370_S00" > Sarah acknowledges them.</a><a name="ts_706510_709450_S00" > I hear you, but I don&#x27;t have to listen to you or fight you.</a><a name="ts_709530_710710_S00" > I&#x27;m choosing connection.</a><a name="ts_710710_711770_S00" > So she stays.</a><a name="ts_711930_713664_S00" > She engages in small talk.</a><a name="ts_714304_715490_S00" > She even enjoys herself.</a><a name="ts_715770_717350_S00" > And over time she realizes something.</a><a name="ts_717450_719570_S00" > The more she drives toward her values,</a><a name="ts_719750_722470_S00" > the less power the passengers have.</a><a name="ts_722730_723510_S00" > They might come.</a><a name="ts_723930_724590_S00" > They might go.</a><a name="ts_724810_725850_S00" > Sometimes they&#x27;re loud.</a><a name="ts_726330_727330_S00" > Generally, they&#x27;re quieter.</a><a name="ts_727530_728510_S00" > And most importantly,</a><a name="ts_728730_730190_S00" > they don&#x27;t get to steer anymore.</a><a name="ts_730490_732990_S00" > She starts to build better and deeper friendships,</a><a name="ts_733010_734990_S00" > and she starts to feel more comfortable being around people.</a><a name="ts_735430_737530_S00" > Sometimes those passengers still yell at her.</a><a name="ts_737530_739950_S00" > Oh my gosh, I can&#x27;t believe you said that yesterday.</a><a name="ts_739950_740960_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_740960_740384_S00" > Right.</a><a name="ts_740384_741856_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_741856_743904_S00" > But she just doesn&#x27;t listen to them as much.</a><a name="ts_744608_748690_S00" > This is how the passengers on the bus exercise can help with social anxiety.</a><a name="ts_748730_750450_S00" > You don&#x27;t have to silence the fear.</a><a name="ts_750630_752750_S00" > You just have to keep driving towards what matters.</a><a name="ts_752910_758830_S00" > And really, the way our brains work is when we behaviorally act in a courageous way,</a><a name="ts_758830_761930_S00" > it teaches our brain we don&#x27;t have to be so scared and anxious anymore.</a><a name="ts_762270_763250_S00" > Okay, final thoughts.</a><a name="ts_763550_766810_S00" > Maybe instead of anxiety, you&#x27;re struggling with negative self-talk</a><a name="ts_766810_769310_S00" > or emotion regulation or setting healthy boundaries.</a><a name="ts_769470_772550_S00" > I have posted a lot of videos about those topics,</a><a name="ts_772550_775250_S00" > but I really like the passengers on the bus metaphor</a><a name="ts_775250_778450_S00" > as a tool for improving any of those things.</a><a name="ts_778750_780790_S00" > Because when you see yourself as the driver,</a><a name="ts_780790_784590_S00" > it&#x27;s a really powerful way to shift your relationship with your thoughts and feelings.</a><a name="ts_784710_787850_S00" > You really can coexist with those thoughts</a><a name="ts_787850_790530_S00" > and those emotions or those physical sensations</a><a name="ts_790530_792640_S00" > without letting them take control.</a><a name="ts_793376_795620_S00" > And this is the essence of psychological flexibility.</a><a name="ts_795620_798540_S00" > You don&#x27;t have to control all your thoughts to live a full and meaningful life.</a><a name="ts_798700_801536_S00" > You just have to keep driving in the direction that matters to you.</a><a name="ts_802176_805260_S00" > Okay, if this video is helpful for you and you&#x27;d like to get more tools for your mental health,</a><a name="ts_805520_806880_S00" > you can sign up for my newsletter.</a><a name="ts_807020_811160_S00" > Every week I share a couple of videos and resources that can help you get better at feeling.</a><a name="ts_811400_815860_S00" > And the next time a negative thought or uncomfortable emotion tries to hijack your journey,</a><a name="ts_816360_818380_S00" > remind yourself, I&#x27;m the driver.</a><a name="ts_818600_821408_S00" > The passengers don&#x27;t get to decide where I go.</a><a name="ts_822176_822690_S00" > And then keep driving.</a><a name="ts_823616_824864_S00" > Okay, thanks for watching and take care.</a><a name="ts_825792_827950_S00" > Hey, if you found any part of this video helpful,</a><a name="ts_828170_833370_S00" > I&#x27;d really appreciate it if you could give it a thumbs up or comment below what you found was helpful.</a><a name="ts_833590_836450_S00" > Also, if you can think of someone who might benefit from this video,</a><a name="ts_836630_838530_S00" > if you could share it, that&#x27;ll help them.</a><a name="ts_838710_843610_S00" > But all of these things help tell the algorithm that this content is helpful for people,</a><a name="ts_843710_847410_S00" > and then they&#x27;ll show it to more people who it can help.</a><a name="ts_847690_849130_S00" > So, really appreciate it.</a><a name="ts_849270_850430_S00" > Thank you so much for being here.</a><a name="ts_850590_851074_S00" > Take care.</a></p></div></body>
