into this world, we observe how the adults in our life interact with each other.</a><a name="ts_7104_8896_" > We also start interacting with them.</a><a name="ts_8896_10112_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_10112_16600_" > And from all this observing and experience, we learn lessons about relationships.</a><a name="ts_16600_17984_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_17984_21390_" > These lessons accumulate into patterns.</a><a name="ts_22090_27430_" > We start interacting with others in specific patterns called attachment styles.</a><a name="ts_27430_32000_" > (.....)</a><a name="ts_32000_36480_" > Researchers have identified three unhelpful, harmful, and hurtful attachment styles,</a><a name="ts_36480_39200_" > both for you and the people you&#x27;re interacting with.</a><a name="ts_39420_43060_" > Avoidant attachment, anxious attachment, and disorganized attachment.</a><a name="ts_43936_47020_" > And one helpful attachment style, secure attachment.</a><a name="ts_47968_51060_" > In this video, I want to shed light on avoidant attachment,</a><a name="ts_51340_56900_" > specifically what helps heal it and transform it into secure attachment.</a><a name="ts_56900_58656_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_58656_66592_" > The avoidant attachment style is either a pattern of avoiding relationships and suppressing a need for closeness,</a><a name="ts_67424_72600_" > or pattern of being in relationships and consciously wanting connection,</a><a name="ts_73070_77280_" > but at the same time not knowing what it means to be connected on an emotional level,</a><a name="ts_77952_80010_" > or how to build and nourish that.</a><a name="ts_80010_81024_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_81024_88416_" > People with an avoidant attachment style have learned to exclude emotions from their awareness to feel safe.</a><a name="ts_88416_89952_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_89952_97210_" > This creates problems for people who are avoidantly attached because their unattended emotions transform into feelings of emptiness,</a><a name="ts_97210_103744_" > depression, and frustration, and physical stress, which can affect their blood pressure and heart rate.</a><a name="ts_103744_105152_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_105152_113472_" > It also creates problems for their relationships because they won&#x27;t be able to express themselves and emotionally meet other people.</a><a name="ts_113472_114496_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_114496_120990_" > This applies to all relationships, but especially to romantic relationships, partnerships, marriages,</a><a name="ts_121250_123360_" > because these are emotionally most intimate.</a><a name="ts_123360_124960_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_124960_130090_" > In intimate relationships, avoidance contribute to problems by avoiding the emotional level,</a><a name="ts_130490_133630_" > especially when it comes to negative or uncomfortable emotions.</a><a name="ts_133630_141200_" > In these situations, avoidance will respond by shutting down, dismissing the issue,</a><a name="ts_141460_146180_" > blaming their partner for being too sensitive or unclear in what they want and need,</a><a name="ts_146800_153400_" > stonewalling, getting defensive, postponing the discussion, or trying to fix it,</a><a name="ts_153400_162180_" > but only focusing on the surface level argument and excluding the whole level of attachment needs and emotions.</a><a name="ts_162180_164224_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_164224_168610_" > They might also say what they think their partner wants to hear at the expense of authenticity.</a><a name="ts_168670_173740_" > When asked about their emotional state, they tend to distance themselves,</a><a name="ts_174440_177060_" > and they deny their attachment needs and vulnerability.</a><a name="ts_177180_184416_" > They can be in a funk or agitated mood and not be aware of it when everyone around them has noticed that.</a><a name="ts_184416_185984_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_185984_188530_" > No one is born with an avoidant attachment style.</a><a name="ts_188530_193090_" > This develops when children are modeled avoidant attachment by their caregivers,</a><a name="ts_193470_197670_" > or when they make negative experiences with vulnerability and emotions.</a><a name="ts_197670_199776_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_199776_206120_" > These negative experiences include getting rejected for expressing emotions, often specifically negative ones,</a><a name="ts_206120_208032_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_208032_211170_" > receiving the message something&#x27;s wrong with you for showing vulnerability,</a><a name="ts_211170_212832_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_212832_215360_" > not receiving emotional support when needed,</a><a name="ts_215360_217312_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_217312_222010_" > intrusive questioning about the child&#x27;s inner world, not respecting its privacy and boundaries,</a><a name="ts_222010_228320_" > not talking about feelings, focusing only on fixing the surface level,</a><a name="ts_228320_229792_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_229792_237100_" > and parents that become anxious, panicky, and overwhelmed when their child expresses difficult emotions.</a><a name="ts_237100_246890_" > In these kinds of emotional environments, children learn that they&#x27;re better off deactivating their attachment needs</a><a name="ts_246890_249310_" > and excluding emotions from their awareness.</a><a name="ts_250176_258944_" > Rather than add the sadness of not being understood, heard, and helped, the child concludes unconsciously,</a><a name="ts_259616_262944_" > if emotions don&#x27;t matter, I might as well disregard them.</a><a name="ts_263488_267110_" > Why continue expressing something if it only makes things worse,</a><a name="ts_267110_274144_" > if it makes me stay aware of my pain, and then adds the pain of not being helped?</a><a name="ts_274144_275520_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_275520_280544_" > Interestingly, avoidants often have no memories of what happened for their attachment style to develop.</a><a name="ts_281440_284224_" > They&#x27;ll often say that they had ideal childhoods.</a><a name="ts_285152_290016_" > Perhaps that is because, putting emotions aside, everything else did go really well.</a><a name="ts_290592_294550_" > Maybe they were supported substantially in many other ways,</a><a name="ts_294690_298080_" > for example, in connection to their education and physical needs.</a><a name="ts_298080_299616_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_299616_305056_" > Another reason for avoidantly attached to not remember what formed their attachment style</a><a name="ts_305824_308970_" > is that it&#x27;s hard to remember the things that didn&#x27;t happen.</a><a name="ts_309170_312050_" > And emotional neglect is about what didn&#x27;t happen.</a><a name="ts_312050_313472_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_313472_318656_" > Also because they learn to exclude emotions from their awareness from very early on,</a><a name="ts_318656_319744_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_319744_326496_" > they don&#x27;t have long-term memories of situations that caused them to do that.</a><a name="ts_327168_333300_" > We need to be emotionally activated for significant long-term memories to form.</a><a name="ts_333300_338190_" > So it&#x27;s not that avoidants don&#x27;t want connection,</a><a name="ts_338190_345710_" > but the way they were raised caused blocks to form around their desire for connection.</a><a name="ts_345710_347136_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_347136_351710_" > Turning avoidant attachment into secure attachment means removing those blocks.</a><a name="ts_351710_356736_" > And this starts with understanding the problem first.</a><a name="ts_357600_361020_" > Before any human being is motivated to change anything,</a><a name="ts_361020_364256_" > we need to understand why that would be a good idea.</a><a name="ts_364256_366080_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_366080_372010_" > So healing avoidant attachment starts by gaining awareness of the negative consequences</a><a name="ts_372010_378250_" > of an avoidant attachment style and the positive consequences of secure attachment.</a><a name="ts_378250_383648_" > This also means learning to understand attachment styles in general</a><a name="ts_384448_389050_" > and understanding in which ways an avoidant attachment style</a><a name="ts_389050_393000_" > shows up in someone&#x27;s inner world and relationships.</a><a name="ts_393000_395008_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_395008_399530_" > Before they&#x27;ll be motivated to start their journey, avoidants also need to understand that</a><a name="ts_399530_401850_" > an attachment style is not set in stone.</a><a name="ts_401850_406270_" > They can change and they themselves are capable of making that change happen.</a><a name="ts_406270_412672_" > So for motivation to build, they need to understand that secure attachment is a worthwhile goal</a><a name="ts_413280_416190_" > and that it&#x27;s possible to attain for them personally.</a><a name="ts_416510_419490_" > Those are the two variables that equal motivation.</a><a name="ts_419490_421056_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_421056_424990_" > Then avoidants can move on to identifying and changing unhelpful beliefs they have</a><a name="ts_424990_430170_" > about relationships, emotions, vulnerability, and what makes them valuable.</a><a name="ts_430170_432192_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_432192_434496_" > These unhelpful beliefs are beliefs like,</a><a name="ts_435264_439540_" > what makes me valuable is that I&#x27;m strong, independent, and successful.</a><a name="ts_439540_441216_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_441216_442610_" > Emotions make me feel icky.</a><a name="ts_442610_449480_" > If I allow others to get too close, I&#x27;ll lose myself and I&#x27;ll lose control.</a><a name="ts_449480_451488_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_451488_454560_" > Expressing needs, having needs is not acceptable.</a><a name="ts_455100_459100_" > Love means not burdening others with your needs and problems.</a><a name="ts_459100_460736_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_460736_461390_" > I&#x27;m not good enough.</a><a name="ts_461530_463520_" > I won&#x27;t be able to satisfy my partner.</a><a name="ts_463520_465376_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_465376_469152_" > Target beliefs to change these unhelpful ones into sound like,</a><a name="ts_470016_470592_" > I&#x27;m enough.</a><a name="ts_471424_473728_" > I&#x27;ve got what it takes to make this relationship work.</a><a name="ts_473728_474976_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_474976_478730_" > Emotions, needs, and vulnerability make me human, not unacceptable.</a><a name="ts_478730_480512_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_480512_481600_" > Emotions are important.</a><a name="ts_481600_482624_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_482624_487200_" > An active, deep, inner emotional world can feel really good.</a><a name="ts_487200_488864_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_488864_491580_" > I&#x27;m always in control of my boundaries and choices.</a><a name="ts_491580_493376_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_493376_495232_" > Everyone has emotional needs.</a><a name="ts_495808_503310_" > Denying them causes problems, and turning towards them, taking care of them, is the key to well-being</a><a name="ts_503310_504670_" > and thriving relationships.</a><a name="ts_504670_506710_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_506710_510850_" > avoidance can start increasing their emotional awareness first in themselves.</a><a name="ts_510850_511872_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_511872_520220_" > The root of the problem of an avoidant attachment style is that someone&#x27;s brain was trained early on to exclude emotions from that person&#x27;s awareness.</a><a name="ts_520220_522112_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_522112_530016_" > Practicing emotional awareness means checking in with your emotions, noticing them, allowing them to be there,</a><a name="ts_530880_536064_" > being willing to experience them, and learning how to understand and regulate them.</a><a name="ts_536064_538112_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_538112_539520_" > Avoidantly attached may say,</a><a name="ts_540352_541984_" > Which emotions are you talking about?</a><a name="ts_542720_543920_" > Which is exactly the problem?</a><a name="ts_544160_552940_" > They may have to intentionally pull emotions back into their bodies and give sparks of emotions space to unfold so that,</a><a name="ts_553140_558030_" > over time, emotions can re-enter their awareness and experience.</a><a name="ts_558030_559424_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_559424_564352_" > And again, avoidance need to understand the benefit of this before they&#x27;ll be motivated to work on it.</a><a name="ts_564352_566400_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_566400_571470_" > Avoidance can then learn to trust their emotions, even if they don&#x27;t seem to make sense at a first glance.</a><a name="ts_571470_577504_" > To understand an emotion, for it to make sense, you often need to be with it for a while.</a><a name="ts_577504_578880_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_578880_584430_" > This way, avoidance can learn to factor in the information emotions provide.</a><a name="ts_584790_595830_" > They&#x27;ll be happy to hear it&#x27;s not about giving up on logic and reason, but on balancing it and completing it with emotional data,</a><a name="ts_595830_600440_" > with the greater awareness of emotions in themselves.</a><a name="ts_601000_607260_" > Avoidance can then move on, practicing paying more attention to emotions and attachment needs in others.</a><a name="ts_608256_616220_" > Read between the lines, and look beneath the surface level behavior to see and understand the attachment need beneath.</a><a name="ts_616220_617824_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_617824_623040_" > And after awareness and understanding have improved, avoidance can work on communicating about emotions.</a><a name="ts_623460_631328_" > This means expressing your own emotions, and talking about someone else&#x27;s emotions with that person.</a><a name="ts_631328_632672_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_632672_638464_" > This way, avoidance can learn to take better care of their own and their partner&#x27;s attachment needs,</a><a name="ts_639136_644250_" > which will help both individuals feel better and improve their relationship.</a><a name="ts_644250_646400_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_646400_648900_" > There&#x27;s a lot more that can be said about this kind of a communication.</a><a name="ts_648900_651620_" > You can find more on that in my relationships playlist.</a><a name="ts_651920_653120_" > Till next time, take care.</a><a name="ts_653120_659140_" > And what was important for me to express in this video is that before avoidance can meet their partner emotionally,</a><a name="ts_659440_661600_" > they first have to meet themselves emotionally.</a><a name="ts_661600_661952_" > you, well..</a><a name="ts_661952_671314_" > (.........)</a><a name="ts_671314_661952_" > u</a><a name="ts_661952_671314_" > (.........)</a><a name="ts_671314_661952_" >
