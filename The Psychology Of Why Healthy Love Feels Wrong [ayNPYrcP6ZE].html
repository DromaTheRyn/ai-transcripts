Dr. Patterson, I just did not feel anything, should not love feel like more?</a><a name="ts_77190_78784_" > And that is when it hit me.</a><a name="ts_79392_80680_" > Sarah was not broken.</a><a name="ts_81200_83240_" > Sarah was not incapable of love.</a><a name="ts_83680_88460_" > Sarah&#x27;s nervous system was doing exactly what it had been trained to do for 28 years.</a><a

that passion equals pain, stability feels like death.</a><a name="ts_114752_117490_" > Sarah grew up with a mother who gave love based on performance.</a><a name="ts_117890_119190_" > Good grades meant hugs.</a><a name="ts_119610_121330_" > Bad behavior meant the silent treatment.</a><a name="ts_122080_124060_" > Her father was there, but not really there.</a><a name="ts_124260_125060_" > You know what I mean?</a><a name="ts_125460_128000_" > Present in body, but emotionally unavailable.</a><a name="ts_128800_131520_" > So Sarah learned that love was something you had to earn.</a><a name="ts_132064_133980_" > Something that could be taken away at any moment.</a><a name="ts_134220_136980_" > Something that required constant vigilance to maintain.</a><a name="ts_137728_143170_" > Fast forward to her dating life, every guy who was inconsistent, every man who kept her guessing,</a><a name="ts_143610_148690_" > every relationship where she had to decode mixed signals and fight for scraps of attention,</a><a name="ts_149150_151200_" > those relationships felt like home.</a><a name="ts_152128_155008_" > Not because they were good, but because they were familiar.</a><a

Chaos equals passion.</a><a name="ts_162580_164224_" > Anxiety equals attraction.</a><a name="ts_165152_166944_" > But Mark, Mark felt foreign.</a><a name="ts_167520_169440_" > When he said he would call, he called.</a><a name="ts_170016_171744_" > When he made plans, he kept them.</a><a name="ts_172448_175640_" > When he said he cared about her, his actions matched his words.</a><a name="ts_175840_179600_" > And Sarah&#x27;s trauma-trained brain kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.</a><a name="ts_179840_184160_" > When it did not, when Mark continued to be consistent and kind and available,</a><a name="ts_184160_186976_" > her nervous system started sending alarm bells.</a><a name="ts_187520_188610_" > Something is wrong here.</a><a name="ts_188770_189990_" > This is too easy.</a><a name="ts_190250_191410_" > This cannot be real.</a><a name="ts_191590_193130_" > And you know what the cruelest part is?</a><a name="ts_193290_194870_" > She called it no chemistry.</a><a name="ts_195150_197750_" > She told her friends she just was not feeling it.</a><a name="ts_198070_200096_" > She convinced herself she was settling.</a><a name="ts_200800_203872_" > But what she was actually experiencing was culture shock.</a><a name="ts_204672_209670_" > The culture of healthy love was so foreign to her nervous system that it felt like nothing at all.</a><a name="ts_209950_212288_" > This is happening to millions of people right now.</a><a name="ts_212864_215360_" > You are sitting there wondering why the good ones feel boring.</a><a

name="ts_221792_224928_" > You are sabotaging relationships with people who could actually love you.</a><a name="ts_225536_228950_" > Because your brain keeps scanning for the chaos, it knows how to navigate.</a><a name="ts_228950_230208_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_230208_233470_" > Let me tell you what is really happening in your nervous system when you meet someone</a><a name="ts_233470_234550_" > emotionally available.</a><a name="ts_234770_237770_" > Your amygdala, that little alarm system in your brain,</a><a name="ts_237930_242208_" > it has been programmed by every relationship you have ever witnessed and experienced.</a><a name="ts_242848_246790_" > If you grew up watching your parents fight and make up, fight and make up,</a><a name="ts_246790_249510_" > your brain learned that volatility equals love.</a><a name="ts_249690_254400_" > If you had to perform for affection as a child, your brain learned that love is conditional.</a><a name="ts_254944_259060_" > If the adults in your life were inconsistent with their care, your brain learned that uncertainty</a><a name="ts_259060_259808_" > is normal.</a><a name="ts_260672_265520_" > So, when someone shows up, and they are just steady, your amygdala does not know what to</a><a name="ts_265520_266624_" > do with that information.</a><a name="ts_267232_268390_" > It starts sending signals.</a><a name="ts_268590_270290_" > This person is too available.</a><a name="ts_270610_271450_" > Something is off.</a><a name="ts_271870_272810_" > Where is the challenge?</a><a name="ts_273090_273870_" > Where is the drama?</a><a name="ts_273870_275730_" > This does not feel like love.</a><a name="ts_275950_278880_" > But here is the thing your amygdala does not understand.</a><a name="ts_279488_281856_" > What it is calling love, is actually addiction.</a><a name="ts_282624_286490_" > When someone treats you inconsistently, when they are hot and cold, when they pull away,</a><a name="ts_286650_291230_" > just when you are getting close, your brain releases dopamine, the same chemical involved</a><a name="ts_291230_292256_" > in gambling addiction.</a><a name="ts_292992_297888_" > You get intermittent reinforcement, which is the most addictive reward schedule known to psychology.</a><a name="ts_298496_302270_" > So, when that person finally gives you attention, when they finally choose you,</a><a name="ts_302270_305590_" > When they finally show you affection, it hits like a drug.</a><a name="ts_305810_309610_" > Your brain floods with feel-good chemicals and you think, this is it.</a><a name="ts_309870_310650_" > This is love.</a><a name="ts_310810_311872_" > This is passion.</a><a name="ts_312544_315400_" > But what you are actually experiencing is withdrawal relief.</a><a name="ts_315820_319904_" > You are not high on love, you are high on the end of emotional starvation.</a><a name="ts_320640_322140_" > Real love does not work that way.</a><a name="ts_322440_323720_" > Real love is consistent.</a><a name="ts_323980_324660_" > It is available.</a><a name="ts_324980_327240_" > It is predictable in the best possible way.</a><a name="ts_327440_329740_" > It does not make your heart race with anxiety.</a><a name="ts_330000_331840_" > It makes your nervous system calm down.</a><a name="ts_331840_333420_" > It does not keep you guessing.</a><a name="ts_333640_334520_" > It gives you certainty.</a><a name="ts_334840_336992_" > It does not make you perform for affection.</a><a name="ts_337536_339712_" > It offers unconditional positive regard.</a><a name="ts_340448_342180_" > And if you have never experienced that before,</a><a name="ts_342380_345240_" > if that is not what love looked like in your family of origin,</a><a name="ts_345620_348020_" > then yes, healthy love is going to feel boring.</a><a name="ts_348180_349760_" > It is going to feel like settling.</a><a name="ts_350020_351280_" > It is going to feel wrong.</a><a name="ts_351460_354180_" > Because you are comparing a nourishing meal to junk food</a><a name="ts_354180_357220_" > and wondering where all the immediate gratification went.</a><a name="ts_357460_360120_" > But here&#x27;s what happens when you push through that discomfort.</a><a name="ts_360360_362180_" > When you stay in the boring relationship,</a><a name="ts_362180_366000_" > instead of running toward the chaos, you discover something revolutionary.</a><a name="ts_366000_367008_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_367008_369090_" > When you are not constantly in fight or flight mode,</a><a name="ts_369310_371510_" > when you are not always scanning for threats,</a><a name="ts_371690_375808_" > when you are not performing for love, you have energy for actual intimacy.</a><a name="ts_376608_378850_" > You start to notice things you never noticed before.</a><a name="ts_379070_381770_" > The way they bring you coffee in the morning without being asked.</a><a name="ts_381970_383930_" > The way they listen when you talk about your day.</a><a name="ts_384290_387790_" > The way they remember your dreams and ask about them months later.</a><a name="ts_388250_391456_" > The way they hold space for your emotions without trying to fix you.</a><a name="ts_392096_394910_" > The way they show up for you, even when you are not at your best.</a><a name="ts_395310_396250_" > This is love.</a><a name="ts_396610_400576_" > Not the dramatic, explosive, addictive highs and lows you are used to.</a><a name="ts_401344_403210_" > This is love in its most pure form.</a><a name="ts_403650_405696_" > Love is a verb, not just a feeling.</a><a name="ts_406496_409910_" > Love as a choice made daily, not just an emotion that happens to you,</a><a name="ts_410010_411552_" > and the chemistry you are looking for.</a><a name="ts_412192_412770_" > It is there.</a><a name="ts_412950_413910_" > It is just different.</a><a name="ts_414816_418368_" > It is in the way you can be fully yourself without fear of abandonment.</a><a name="ts_419104_423010_" > It is in the deep intimacy that comes from feeling truly seen and accepted.</a><a name="ts_423250_427360_" > It is in the excitement of building something together instead of constantly tearing it down.</a><a name="ts_427936_430790_" > It is in the spark that comes from security, not insecurity.</a><a name="ts_430790_432032_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_432032_434048_" > Sarah came back to see me six months later.</a><a name="ts_434624_437570_" > She had reached out to Mark, apologized for her confusion,</a><a name="ts_437730_440192_" > and explained what she had learned about herself.</a><a name="ts_441056_442010_" > They took things slow.</a><a name="ts_442210_445810_" > She did some therapy work to understand her patterns, and guess what?</a><a name="ts_445810_448530_" > She started to feel the chemistry she thought was missing.</a><a name="ts_448810_452050_" > Not the anxious, addictive chemistry of her past relationships,</a><a name="ts_452330_456250_" > but the deep, nourishing chemistry of being truly known and loved.</a><a name="ts_456590_458336_" > She told me something that stuck with me.</a><a name="ts_458912_460290_" > I thought love was supposed to hurt.</a><a name="ts_460530_463010_" > I thought if it did not hurt, it was not real.</a><a name="ts_463410_467750_" > But now, I understand that love is not supposed to hurt, healing hurts.</a><a name="ts_468270_470110_" > Love is what happens after the healing.</a><a name="ts_470330_475150_" > So if you are watching this and you have been sabotaging good relationships because they felt boring,</a><a name="ts_475150_479808_" > if you have been chasing people who are emotionally unavailable because that feels like passion,</a><a name="ts_480576_485160_" > if you have been rejecting stability because it feels like settling, I want you to consider this.</a><a name="ts_485640_490100_" > Maybe what feels like boredom is actually your nervous system finally getting to rest.</a><a name="ts_490420_493600_" > Maybe what feels like settling is actually leveling up.</a><a name="ts_494176_497850_" > Maybe what feels like lack of chemistry is actually the presence of safety.</a><a name="ts_498190_501990_" > The most radical thing you can do is choose the love that feels boring.</a><a name="ts_502210_503970_" > Stay with the person who shows up.</a><a name="ts_503970_508250_" > Give the relationship that does not trigger your trauma responses a real chance.</a><a name="ts_508630_510150_" > Choose healing over familiar.</a><a name="ts_510470_512030_" > Choose peace over chaos.</a><a name="ts_512370_517408_" > Choose the love you think you do not deserve until you realize you have deserved it all along.</a><a name="ts_518176_520860_" > Because the love you are looking for is not in the chaos.</a><a name="ts_521060_522240_" > It is in the calm.</a><a name="ts_522460_523960_" > It is not in the uncertainty.</a><a name="ts_524260_525360_" > It is in the security.</a><a name="ts_525620_526740_" > It is not in the drama.</a><a name="ts_526740_527960_" > It is in the peace.</a><a name="ts_528140_532920_" > And once you experience real love, I promise you, you will never want to go back to the</a><a name="ts_532920_534176_" >
