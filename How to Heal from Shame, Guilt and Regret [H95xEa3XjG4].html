It can impact every aspect of our lives, and I&#x27;m making like</a><a name="ts_5420_12340_S02" > four more videos about it. But there&#x27;s one fundamental aspect of shame, that when you get super clear on it,</a><a name="ts_12420_17680_S02" > when you make it concrete, you can make huge strides toward healing, toward regaining your</a><a name="ts_17680_23960_S02" > sense of self-confidence and self-esteem so that you can feel a clear conscience. So today we&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_23960_28260_S02" > going to be talking about the one question you need to ask to clarify guilt, shame, and regret,</a><a name="ts_28820_34960_S02" > and one choice that will heal it. And I made a cool little flow chart to nerd out over, so let&#x27;s jump</a><a name="ts_34960_44650_S02" > in. Okay, so guilt is the emotion that comes up when we think, I&#x27;ve made a mistake. Guilt&#x27;s an</a><a name="ts_44650_49890_S02" > uncomfortable emotion, but it&#x27;s not a negative one. That&#x27;s because all pure emotions serve a function,</a><a name="ts_49890_55450_S02" > and guilt can motivate us to fix it when we&#x27;ve hurt someone. More on this later, but if guilt says,</a><a name="ts_55450_63830_S02" > I made a mistake, shame says, I am a mistake. Shame is more than feeling like you messed up. It&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_63830_69650_S02" > believing that you&#x27;re irrecoverable, that what you&#x27;ve done is so bad that if people really knew you,</a><a name="ts_69790_76290_S02" > they&#x27;d attack you and reject you. Shame shows up in a couple areas of our life. It shows up in our mind</a><a name="ts_76290_82070_S02" > with thoughts like, I&#x27;m worthless, I&#x27;m bad, I&#x27;m never good enough, or I&#x27;m a failure, I&#x27;m a loser, or I&#x27;m</a><a name="ts_82070_86110_S02" > broken, or defective. It&#x27;s all my fault. So those are some of the thoughts that come with shame.</a><a name="ts_86250_93370_S02" > But shame also shows up in our body with a slumped posture, a downward gaze, turning away,</a><a name="ts_94350_98650_S02" > withdrawing, hiding, shrinking, freezing. And in some of my other videos, I&#x27;m going to talk about this,</a><a name="ts_98650_103990_S02" > but if you look at how soccer players react when they&#x27;ve messed up, they&#x27;re shrinking. They&#x27;re making</a><a name="ts_103990_111010_S02" > themselves small. They&#x27;re covering their faces, right? Okay, shame also comes with some actions.</a><a name="ts_111410_117690_S02" > So these include giving up, hiding our true selves, trying to fit in and people please,</a><a name="ts_118170_123530_S02" > having really poor boundaries. It can also look like perfectionism, isolation, and self-sabotage.</a><a name="ts_123650_127670_S02" > So in other videos, I&#x27;m going to talk about how shame shows up in each of these three areas,</a><a name="ts_127670_132890_S02" > but today we&#x27;re going to talk about the choice you can make about shame, guilt, and regret,</a><a name="ts_132890_142050_S02" > and how you can get to here, fueling this cycle of healing and reparation and confidence and</a><a name="ts_142050_147500_S02" > connection. Okay, so back to the top. Let&#x27;s define regret. Regret is saying,</a><a name="ts_147520_153360_S02" > Ooh, I wish I had done things differently now that I know differently. It&#x27;s usually looking back on</a><a name="ts_153360_158820_S02" > whatever happened in the past that led to the guilt and the longing to be able to change what you did.</a><a name="ts_158820_165720_S02" > And the pitfall with regret is that people often get stuck ruminating or overthinking their past</a><a name="ts_165720_172280_S02" > mistakes. Now, if we look at these three, guilt, shame, and regret, guilt is a pretty healthy emotion</a><a name="ts_172280_178720_S02" > because it can trigger healthy action. Shame is a pretty toxic emotion. It usually does not help us</a><a name="ts_178720_184360_S02" > take helpful action in any way. Same with regret. Regret is like, I&#x27;m going to ruminate on it. I&#x27;m going to</a><a name="ts_184360_189980_S02" > think about it over and over again. So guilt, we kind of actually want to shift toward clarifying</a><a name="ts_189980_195980_S02" > guilt. So let&#x27;s start at square one, right? You feel shame, guilt, or regret. Here&#x27;s the one question</a><a name="ts_195980_202820_S02" > to ask. Did I do something wrong? This is super important because if our honest answer is yes,</a><a name="ts_203360_209720_S02" > then we&#x27;re experiencing guilt about something that we can take action on to make repairs, okay? So that&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_209720_214300_S02" > the choice. We&#x27;re going to come back to that. But victims of trauma frequently blame themselves for</a><a name="ts_214300_220300_S02" > situations that were beyond their control. That&#x27;s one form of shame. It will eat you up. And I made an</a><a name="ts_220300_227280_S02" > entire video about this, but let me summarize. Due to intense, overwhelming emotions that come up after</a><a name="ts_227280_233120_S02" > trauma, the brain often takes a shortcut to self-blame. And this might even have a protective factor to it,</a><a name="ts_233160_239280_S02" > but it&#x27;s still faulty, and it&#x27;s still harmful, and it&#x27;s still a form of toxic shame. There&#x27;s three common</a><a name="ts_239280_244060_S02" > ways victims blame themselves. Number one, they take full responsibility for every situation.</a><a name="ts_244060_249260_S02" > They might say something like, it&#x27;s my fault my parents got divorced, or it&#x27;s my fault my brother</a><a name="ts_249260_255810_S02" > died, okay? Number two, they believe they should have seen it coming. Like, oh, I should have known that it</a><a name="ts_255810_261450_S02" > would rain on my wedding day. I should have known that this guy would have ended up becoming abusive,</a><a name="ts_261450_267310_S02" > right? Or number three, they make it about their own personal deficiencies. They say, oh, I&#x27;m just so</a><a name="ts_267890_273530_S02" > lazy, stupid, inconsiderate, idiotic, clumsy, right? It can be surprisingly easy to fill in that blank.</a><a name="ts_273750_280770_S02" > So this is the first way that shame can be really toxic when it convinces you that the horrible thing</a><a name="ts_280770_286420_S02" > that happened was your fault. Rape victims might believe it was because they wore certain clothes.</a><a name="ts_286660_293100_S02" > Victims of a mugging think that they should have somehow known not to walk to work that day. Or a husband</a><a name="ts_293100_297568_S02" > whose wife cheated on him believes it&#x27;s because he wasn&#x27;t attractive or loving enough. So</a><a name="ts_297568_298624_S02" > (.)</a><a name="ts_298624_303710_S02" > it&#x27;s really important as we ask this question, did I actually do something wrong? Here&#x27;s the</a><a name="ts_303710_310330_S02" > exercise I do to help my clients clarify. Just a sec. We&#x27;re gonna need a piece of paper. Take a piece</a><a name="ts_310330_317910_S02" > of paper, and you fold it in half or draw a line down the middle, and you write on one side of the piece</a><a name="ts_317910_329960_S02" > paper the actions you took. My actions. And the other half you put their actions, okay? And you write</a><a name="ts_329960_334960_S02" > down what you did, and you write down what they did, okay? And then when you&#x27;re done writing it down,</a><a name="ts_334960_342960_S02" > you tear it in half. And that&#x27;s because your choices did not cause their choices. Yeah,</a><a name="ts_343120_346300_S02" > you&#x27;re responsible for what? What would you have written down on this side? You&#x27;re responsible for</a><a name="ts_346300_353040_S02" > wearing clothes? You&#x27;re responsible for walking to work? You&#x27;re responsible for whether you&#x27;re loving</a><a name="ts_353040_358750_S02" > towards your spouse? And the other side? Them? They&#x27;re responsible for rape, for violence, for theft,</a><a name="ts_358750_365670_S02" > for breaking their marriage promises. You are only responsible for your side of this. They are 100%</a><a name="ts_365670_370710_S02" > responsible for their side of this. You&#x27;re not responsible for their choices. Now, of course,</a><a name="ts_370710_375950_S02" > you can change what you wear, where you walk, or how you love your spouse. But none of these things are</a><a name="ts_375950_383490_S02" > crimes. Rape is a crime. Violence and theft is a crime. And you did not cause them to do those actions,</a><a name="ts_383490_388950_S02" > okay? But what about the husband, right? He did not cause his wife to cheat. That was her choice.</a><a name="ts_389310_394390_S02" > But he knows in his heart that he didn&#x27;t treat her with as much love as he wanted to. And he regrets</a><a name="ts_394390_400540_S02" > that. So what do we do with that? That was one of his choices, right? So he could have written,</a><a name="ts_400700_409790_S02" > I didn&#x27;t take out the trash as often as I should have, right? I didn&#x27;t show her love by serving her in</a><a name="ts_409790_416070_S02" > the kitchen. So when we go to clarify on this little flowchart here, with the first two examples,</a><a name="ts_416070_422730_S02" > there&#x27;s a clear no. Actually, I did nothing wrong. So we&#x27;re going to follow this line here from the no.</a><a name="ts_423350_430010_S02" > Actually, I did nothing wrong. I&#x27;m not guilty. I have nothing to be ashamed of. And gaining that</a><a name="ts_430010_435730_S02" > clarity helps us fuel this cycle of healing, reparation, and compassion, right? We&#x27;re going to</a><a name="ts_435730_440810_S02" > treat ourself and others with love. We&#x27;re going to reach out for support and love for the people who</a><a name="ts_440810_446150_S02" > truly see you and know you and love them. Okay? So going back to the husband, let&#x27;s go back to the</a><a name="ts_446150_453470_S02" > husband. Did he do something wrong? The husband, deep in his heart, can honestly say no. I did not cause my</a><a name="ts_453470_460620_S02" > wife to cheat. That was her decision. And I truly want to love her better. That&#x27;s a regret. So that specific</a><a name="ts_460620_466180_S02" > area is a yes. Again, he did not cause the cheating. He&#x27;s not responsible for that. And deep in his heart,</a><a name="ts_466180_470560_S02" > he knows that he should have taken the trash out more. Now, I want to be really clear here. I am</a><a name="ts_470560_475340_S02" > not saying that this caused his wife to cheat. These are two separate people with two separate</a><a name="ts_475340_479820_S02" > responsibilities. I&#x27;m just saying we all have a deep sense of what is right. And when we know that</a><a name="ts_479820_483700_S02" > we&#x27;ve gone against our deepest sense of what is right, when we&#x27;ve gone against our conscience or our</a><a name="ts_483700_490680_S02" > values, we can choose to heal by taking accountability for ourselves, even when other people have harmed us</a><a name="ts_490680_494880_S02" > greatly, and they&#x27;re responsible for that. We just have to be really honest and not take accountability for</a><a name="ts_494880_500020_S02" > them. So if we want to fuel cycles of healing, growth, connection, and honesty in our personal</a><a name="ts_500020_505160_S02" > lives and in society, we have to know what to do with a yes answer. So let&#x27;s say you ask yourself,</a><a name="ts_505180_511780_S02" > did I really do something wrong? And your answer is yes, okay? Right here, here&#x27;s the choice. This is</a><a name="ts_511780_518144_S02" > super important. This is the deciding point of whether you&#x27;re going to let shame and regret poison you,</a><a name="ts_518688_524330_S02" > or you&#x27;re going to heal. Now, if you face it and you make repairs, you are going to fuel a cycle of</a><a name="ts_524330_529730_S02" > healing. And we&#x27;re going to talk more on this later. But the most natural thing to do with shame, guilt,</a><a name="ts_529730_536310_S02" > and regret is to hide. In one of the oldest stories, after Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit,</a><a name="ts_536670_541650_S02" > two things happened in quick succession. Adam and Eve tried to hide from God, and when God found them,</a><a name="ts_541790_547230_S02" > Adam blamed Eve for his choice. This story has been passed down for thousands of years because it</a><a name="ts_547230_552870_S02" > resonates with each of us. When we mess up, when we feel shame, the most natural thing to do</a><a name="ts_552870_557390_S02" > is to hide. And our very clever brain can be very creative in how we try to hide from others</a><a name="ts_557390_563190_S02" > and from our own sense of responsibility. It can look like covering up your mistake, blaming others,</a><a name="ts_563510_569230_S02" > making excuses like everyone else was doing it, seeking any form of emotional numbing or distraction,</a><a name="ts_569230_576730_S02" > like screens or detaching from others or drug use, right? And it&#x27;s really common, but a strange form of</a><a name="ts_576730_582810_S02" > self-protection is labeling yourself as broken. So that&#x27;s like saying, well, I just suck at relationships.</a><a name="ts_582910_589530_S02" > I&#x27;ll never be any good, with the implied, so it&#x27;s not my fault and it&#x27;s not worth the energy to try to fix it.</a><a name="ts_589650_595630_S02" > So this is another super common form of self-justification. It feels vindicating. It feels</a><a name="ts_595630_601850_S02" > better than taking responsibility, at least in the short term, but it fuels toxic shame. When you believe,</a><a name="ts_601850_608160_S02" > oh, there&#x27;s no hope for someone as broken or as bad as me, so I&#x27;ll just keep doing destructive stuff.</a><a name="ts_608864_612710_S02" > Or you think, oh, I let my old boyfriend keep mistreating me. I didn&#x27;t set good boundaries,</a><a name="ts_612710_619210_S02" > so no one would want a healthy relationship with someone as flawed as me. I guess I&#x27;m just doomed to</a><a name="ts_619210_625750_S02" > settle for crappy relationships. This is one of the most pervasive forms of toxic shame. And all of us</a><a name="ts_625750_630810_S02" > have made some mistakes in our lives. That&#x27;s normal. All of us can say, yes, I&#x27;ve messed up. But when we label</a><a name="ts_630810_637290_S02" > ourselves as broken, bad, or defective, that&#x27;s when we cross the line from a mistake that we can fix</a><a name="ts_637290_643970_S02" > to fueling toxic shame. Now, shame is a liar. It&#x27;s a distortion of guilt. It takes you from something</a><a name="ts_643970_651550_S02" > actionable, like I should fix that, to a hopeless place with few options. So to heal from shame, we need</a><a name="ts_651550_657790_S02" > to catch ourselves in this form of hiding and self-justifying and constantly make the choice</a><a name="ts_657790_664830_S02" > place to shift our attention back to making repairs, okay? So usually the biggest obstacle is the</a></p><p ><a name="ts_664830_673050_S03" >S03: label we give ourselves. Labels not make you happy. Good. Bad. You must love you.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_673450_677650_S02" >S02: If I&#x27;m going to say it bluntly, if you&#x27;re labeling yourself as broken, bad, or defective,</a><a name="ts_677790_683310_S02" > it&#x27;s because believing that is doing something for you. It&#x27;s helping you avoid the vulnerable work</a><a name="ts_683310_689640_S02" > of taking accountability and making repairs. Now, I know that it feels like you&#x27;re taking too much</a><a name="ts_689640_695700_S02" > accountability, but if it doesn&#x27;t lead to helpful action, it&#x27;s just a mental habit that&#x27;s actually</a><a name="ts_695700_701380_S02" > comforting and avoiding accountability. Okay, so when we do any of these things, blaming others,</a><a name="ts_701620_706960_S02" > covering up our mistakes, making excuses, detaching, numbing, or labeling ourselves as broken,</a><a name="ts_706960_716760_S02" > we are fueling this cycle of hurt for ourselves and for others, okay? That&#x27;s what fuels this cycle</a><a name="ts_716760_721980_S02" > of toxic shame. Let me tell you about a TED talk I watched. I watched this incredible TEDx talk the other</a><a name="ts_721980_726820_S02" > day. It was about a woman named Thordis, and she was date raped by a man named Tom when they were both</a><a name="ts_726820_734280_S02" > teenagers. She had gotten drunk and he took advantage of her. Now, afterwards, she blamed herself and shame</a><a name="ts_734280_740120_S02" > fueled depression. It was years before she even identified the situation as rape, and even more</a></p><p ><a name="ts_740120_745880_S00" >S00: years before she realized, the only thing that could have stopped me from being raped that night</a><a name="ts_745880_753420_S00" > is the man who raped me, had he stopped himself. That realization helped free her from false shame.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_753540_758280_S02" >S02: She spent years trying to think, what should I have done differently to prevent this? And when she moved</a><a name="ts_758280_764000_S02" > toward more honesty, more accountability, she realized Tom was responsible for this. Okay,</a><a name="ts_764910_770830_S02" > meanwhile, Tom did not mentally acknowledge that what he had done was rape. Let me back up.</a><a name="ts_771230_776000_S02" > Thordis was stuck in false shame. She was blaming herself for something that was not her fault.</a><a name="ts_776768_783010_S02" > Meanwhile, Tom didn&#x27;t mentally acknowledge that what he had done was rape. So he was trying to justify</a><a name="ts_783010_788450_S02" > and kind of numb himself. He justified it by trying to convince himself that it was sex. He said,</a></p><p ><a name="ts_788450_793350_S01" >S01: What followed is a nine-year period that can best be titled as denial and running.</a><a name="ts_793350_794720_S01" > (.)</a></p><p ><a name="ts_794720_798480_S02" >S02: He was distracting himself. He was trying to convince himself that he was a good person.</a><a name="ts_799320_804700_S02" > So during all these years, Thordis took out her anger and fear on herself, and shame isolated her from</a><a name="ts_804700_809660_S02" > real relationships. One day, she shakenly wrote a letter to Tom telling him how she&#x27;d been affected</a><a name="ts_809660_816120_S02" > and telling him, I want forgiveness because she deserved personal peace. And Tom surprisingly,</a><a name="ts_817000_822860_S02" > courageously replied, and he shifted to where we&#x27;re going next, right? This is how we heal from shame.</a><a name="ts_823000_828460_S02" > He owned up to what he&#x27;d done. For eight years, they wrote to each other, and they worked through</a><a name="ts_828460_833020_S02" > their pain and their responsibilities, and each of them listened to each other and shared. Eventually,</a><a name="ts_833020_840220_S02" > they met in person. They even wrote a book together to help people from both ends of the perpetrator-survivor</a><a name="ts_840220_847150_S02" > scale. So what they did took incredible courage. Honest accountability is hard, but living a life</a><a name="ts_847150_852430_S02" > where you&#x27;re running from the truth is harder, and this is how we heal from shame. Most people simply</a><a name="ts_852430_860410_S02" > don&#x27;t know how to make repairs. So making repairs when you&#x27;ve made a mistake looks like these steps,</a><a name="ts_860430_866990_S02" > and this is what Tom did, okay? The first step is to take accountability and to say,</a><a name="ts_866990_872850_S02" > I made a mistake. Second step is to empathize, to imagine how that impacted someone else.</a><a name="ts_872990_876890_S02" > You might say something like, that must have hurt you, or scared you, or inconvenienced you.</a><a name="ts_877610_884210_S02" > And the third step is to listen. You might ask, how did that hurt you? The fourth step is to make repairs.</a><a name="ts_884590_889950_S02" > What can I do to make it right? So for example, if you stole something, it&#x27;s your job to repay it,</a><a name="ts_889990_896060_S02" > to pay it back, to work it off, whatever it takes to make it right for that person. The fifth step is to</a><a name="ts_896060_900080_S02" > learn from the experience, like, oh, what do I need to learn to prevent this from happening in the</a><a name="ts_900080_905860_S02" > future? What skills do I need to develop? Tom had to learn about respecting women and seeing them as</a><a name="ts_905860_910800_S02" > equals. A thief might need to learn new job skills so that they can feed their family and they don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_910800_916600_S02" > have to steal to feed their family. And then the sixth step is to try not to do it again. This isn&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_916600_921700_S02" > just like white-knuckling, it&#x27;s building up skills and resources through practice to prevent</a><a name="ts_921700_926920_S02" > yourself from choosing to act that way. I really like the content creator Jimmy on relationships. He tells</a><a name="ts_926920_932460_S02" > on his channel how he cheated on his wife, and then he spent the next years learning the skills</a><a name="ts_932460_938100_S02" > how to have a deep and fulfilling relationship, how to listen to and support his wife, how to be honest,</a><a name="ts_938140_944660_S02" > how to set healthy boundaries, and how to ask for his needs. He channeled that guilt and regret into action,</a><a name="ts_944660_951370_S02" > and that helped his marriage too, and now he&#x27;s helping others learn from it as well. Making repairs is really</a><a name="ts_951370_957090_S02" > hard, but when you&#x27;ve started to practice it, you can start to feel this incredible energy and peace that</a><a name="ts_957090_963390_S02" > comes from it. And I think this is really important. If you look at the AA steps, a lot of them involve</a><a name="ts_963390_968930_S02" > getting really honest, taking an honest inventory of yourselves, making repairs where it&#x27;s helpful,</a><a name="ts_968950_976590_S02" > and learning to do something different moving forward. And when you fuel this cycle of healing and</a><a name="ts_976590_980830_S02" > reparation and compassion, you&#x27;re going to start to feel differently. You&#x27;re going to feel a clear</a><a name="ts_980830_986110_S02" > conscience. You&#x27;re going to feel more confident. You&#x27;re going to feel like you can truly show yourself to</a><a name="ts_986110_990490_S02" > others. You don&#x27;t have to keep hiding, and your relationships are going to become more real</a><a name="ts_990490_998090_S02" > and deep. Okay, so this is one of the ways we heal shame. The first way is getting really honest and</a><a name="ts_998090_1002130_S02" > saying, I did nothing wrong. I&#x27;m not guilty. I have nothing to be ashamed of. The second way is to say,</a><a name="ts_1002210_1007310_S02" > yeah, actually, I did mess up. I&#x27;m going to face it. I&#x27;m going to make repairs. I&#x27;m going to take</a><a name="ts_1007310_1014460_S02" > accountability, and I&#x27;m going to learn from this experience and try not to do it again. Let&#x27;s talk about</a><a name="ts_1015040_1020220_S02" > regret just for a minute, right? What do we do with old hurts? What do we do with regret?</a><a name="ts_1021040_1025220_S02" > Especially when things happened a long time ago or feel like it&#x27;s something we can&#x27;t repair.</a><a name="ts_1025760_1031180_S02" > With regret, our brain has a sneaky way of avoiding and hiding from accountability,</a><a name="ts_1031180_1035980_S02" > and it&#x27;s called rumination. You think and you think and you think about the mistakes you made,</a><a name="ts_1035980_1041780_S02" > and your brain pretends that this is helpful, so you keep doing it. But dwelling on the past actually</a><a name="ts_1041780_1045660_S02" > perpetuates the hurt. You&#x27;re making yourself miserable, and you&#x27;re not helping anyone else</a><a name="ts_1045660_1050700_S02" > either. So you&#x27;ve got to go right back to the choice here, right back to the choice, and you&#x27;ve</a><a name="ts_1050700_1056360_S02" > got to choose to make repairs instead of ruminate. It&#x27;s the same steps. But how do you make repairs for</a><a name="ts_1056360_1061900_S02" > something that happened so long ago or impacted people so much or something you cannot fix, right? So a</a><a name="ts_1061900_1067400_S02" > common example is a parent who looks back and wishes they&#x27;d been more loving or supportive. Maybe their</a><a name="ts_1067400_1072910_S02" > kids have cut them off. Another content creator, the holistic psychologist, made a great post the</a><a name="ts_1072910_1077170_S02" > other day. Here&#x27;s what she said, here&#x27;s what an adult child wants to hear from their parent.</a><a name="ts_1077250_1082850_S02" > It&#x27;s also called accountability. I know I didn&#x27;t always handle my emotions well, and I was overwhelmed</a><a name="ts_1082850_1087910_S02" > often. I can see how that would have been scary for you growing up, and I&#x27;m so sorry that you had to deal</a><a name="ts_1087910_1094490_S02" > with that alone. Or another example, I know I was highly critical and demanded perfection. I was too tough on you.</a><a name="ts_1094490_1099710_S02" > It&#x27;s the same way I&#x27;m too tough on myself. You deserved more softness and more kindness, and I&#x27;m</a><a name="ts_1099710_1105520_S02" > gonna work on speaking that way to you now. Notice that step of, like, I&#x27;m gonna work on it now, here</a><a name="ts_1105520_1111900_S02" > in the present moment. That&#x27;s very different from defending or justifying or ruminating on the past.</a><a name="ts_1111980_1116590_S02" > It&#x27;s like, I&#x27;m gonna work on this now. Okay, here&#x27;s another example. Some of the punishments I gave you</a><a name="ts_1116590_1121830_S02" > were harmful. I was given those same punishments, and I see now that they were wrong. I&#x27;m sorry, and I hope</a><a name="ts_1121830_1125910_S02" > that you can understand how much I regret it. And you&#x27;ll notice the comments. Someone commented on</a><a name="ts_1125910_1132230_S02" > this saying about their own parents, they&#x27;d rather die on the hill of, I did the best I could, or you</a><a name="ts_1132230_1137930_S02" > weren&#x27;t exactly an easy child, which is why going no contact was in my best interest. So the reason that</a><a name="ts_1137930_1145030_S02" > kid went no contact is because their parent shifted to shame. They said, well, I did the best I could.</a><a name="ts_1145090_1150070_S02" > They&#x27;re making excuses. Or they blamed another kid. You weren&#x27;t an easy child. Instead of just taking</a><a name="ts_1150070_1155430_S02" > accountability, man, that was a hard time for you. That was a hard time for me. That must have hurt</a><a name="ts_1155430_1163520_S02" > you. What can I do now to make it not keep perpetuating that hurt? Excuses and self-justification</a><a name="ts_1163520_1172620_S02" > fuel shame and distancing. And accountability fuels connection. So with regret, instead of regretting the</a><a name="ts_1172620_1179300_S02" > past, learn to make those changes here in the present moment. If you can&#x27;t connect with or talk with the</a><a name="ts_1179300_1184540_S02" > person you&#x27;ve harmed, perhaps you take action by going to therapy to learn new skills, or practicing</a><a name="ts_1184540_1188980_S02" > compassion in the present moment, or sharing your story with others so they can avoid making the same</a><a name="ts_1188980_1195020_S02" > mistakes. There is always an action available here in the present moment to line your life up with your</a><a name="ts_1195020_1201970_S02" > values. The way we heal is to constantly shift our attention and our efforts toward honesty, accountability,</a><a name="ts_1202070_1207820_S02" > and healing. Now, I think it&#x27;s important to note that shame is like black mold. It thrives in dark,</a><a name="ts_1207820_1213140_S02" > hidden places. It thrives the more we hide, the more we try to not let other people see our shame</a><a name="ts_1213140_1221500_S02" > or our guilt. That fuels toxic shame. And like mold, it dies in the sunlight. We heal shame when we connect</a><a name="ts_1221500_1227200_S02" > with other people. This is why confession and connection is essential. As long as you&#x27;re hiding</a><a name="ts_1227200_1232000_S02" > yourself from others, you&#x27;ll never feel truly safe and loved because you&#x27;ll think, if they truly knew me,</a><a name="ts_1232000_1237940_S02" > they despise me. But the shocking truth is that when people humbly truly show themselves, when they</a><a name="ts_1237940_1242460_S02" > take accountability, people tend to be way more generous and accepting than you&#x27;d ever believe</a><a name="ts_1242460_1248760_S02" > than when you&#x27;re hiding in shame. And I&#x27;m referring to people in person, not the internet, okay? You cannot</a><a name="ts_1248760_1252940_S02" > do this work alone. Do it with a therapist. Do it with a support group. Write a letter. Write a book. Tell your</a><a name="ts_1252940_1261270_S02" > closest friends. Shame isolates. Connection heals. Okay, so to summarize, when we feel guilt, shame,</a><a name="ts_1261270_1266910_S02" > or regret, we ask one question and we get to make one choice. So first we have to ask the question,</a><a name="ts_1266950_1273390_S02" > did I actually make a mistake? Trauma can make us falsely blame ourselves. And if the answer is yes,</a><a name="ts_1273410_1280210_S02" > I actually did make a mistake, we want to shift away from shame-fueled labels like, oh, I&#x27;m just a bad person,</a><a name="ts_1280210_1288220_S02" > to action words. I made a mistake. Shift away from labels to action. Make the choice, face it,</a><a name="ts_1288420_1292460_S02" > take steps to make repairs, take accountability, admit your faults, empathize with their hurt,</a><a name="ts_1292500_1299030_S02" > and learn from the experience. Okay, here&#x27;s my last thought. You may be thinking, but what I&#x27;ve done</a><a name="ts_1299030_1307370_S02" > is so hurtful that I can never repair the harm I&#x27;ve done. That may be true. As humans, we often make</a><a name="ts_1307370_1313030_S02" > mistakes that we cannot fix on our own, but I personally believe there&#x27;s a natural force of</a><a name="ts_1313030_1318650_S02" > grace, light, and healing in the universe. Now, I attribute it to God. You can attribute it to</a><a name="ts_1318650_1325300_S02" > whatever you&#x27;d like, but if you carefully observe, life gives opportunities to heal over time. One time,</a><a name="ts_1325320_1330260_S02" > I was in an ancient cave in Great Basin National Park, and we were walking through these amazing formations,</a><a name="ts_1330320_1336340_S02" > stalactites, stalagmites, cave bacon, and just these gorgeous formations. Now, these formations had taken</a><a name="ts_1336340_1344060_S02" > hundreds of thousands of years to form drip by drip. A tiny molecule of mineral gets left on the end of</a><a name="ts_1344060_1349540_S02" > a drip, and over thousands of years, these gorgeous formations are made. But a few decades ago, humans</a><a name="ts_1349540_1354780_S02" > found the cave and thought, hey, this is neat. I want to take this home with me, and they broke off some of</a><a name="ts_1354780_1359580_S02" > the stalactites and the stalagmites. They broke off some of these formations, and you could see these</a><a name="ts_1359580_1367810_S02" > broken ends of these thousands-year-old formations. And I can still feel the pain of that damage,</a><a name="ts_1367810_1374350_S02" > and it&#x27;s damage that they couldn&#x27;t repair. Now the formations are protected, right? There&#x27;s fencing,</a><a name="ts_1374630_1382370_S02" > and no one&#x27;s busting them off anymore. But it feels like, oh, how could we possibly heal from this? But if</a><a name="ts_1382370_1388910_S02" > you look carefully, I found one little broken stalactite that had started to heal. And on the stump of its</a><a name="ts_1388910_1393930_S02" > little broken off end, it had already started to grow a new formation, a little nub. And even</a><a name="ts_1393930_1400330_S02" > though it hadn&#x27;t fully repaired, the universe is patient, and eternity is a long time. I personally</a><a name="ts_1400330_1405050_S02" > believe the force of healing is strong, and with time all things can be healed. Little by little,</a><a name="ts_1405090_1411090_S02" > that stalactite will grow long and beautiful again. And I think if you look around you, you can see glimmers</a><a name="ts_1411090_1418240_S02" > of this healing everywhere, the drive toward healing and love and connection. I hope this helps you feel it.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_1419008_1423250_S00" >S00: Thank you for watching, and take care.
