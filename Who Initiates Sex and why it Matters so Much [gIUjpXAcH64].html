And yet, judging from</a><a name="ts_13030_18850_" > the heartache it tends to generate, it appears to matter very much indeed. It&#x27;s at the root</a><a name="ts_18850_24530_" > of many affairs. It is the catalyst for vicious arguments and bitterness. The long-term future</a><a name="ts_24530_30290_" > of small children can be decided by it and couples routinely end up in therapy or, more</a><a name="ts_30290_36370_" > often, the divorce courts because of it. At the heart of the drama are all the complexities</a><a name="ts_36370_43010_" > involved when late at night, in the darkness, one person&#x27;s hand moves over to tentatively</a><a name="ts_43010_49664_" > touch the other&#x27;s body in a way that signals a desire to initiate either sex or a cuddle</a><a name="ts_50336_56520_" > and nothing much happens in return. This move ends up being so much more fraught</a><a name="ts_56520_63080_" > than one might imagine because it has so little to do with making love. It is about knowing</a><a name="ts_63080_70190_" > that we are wanted. The willingness to initiate sex can appear like the litmus test of whether</a><a name="ts_70190_75410_" > one is appreciated within the relationship as a whole and, therefore, whether a couple</a><a name="ts_75410_83070_" > remains a going concern or not. For one person never to initiate or else merely to respond half-heartedly</a><a name="ts_83070_88290_" > to caresses is tantamount to declaring that they cannot possibly love the person they</a><a name="ts_88290_96400_" > are with. In truth, a lack of initiation or response can mean many things. It may, at points,</a><a name="ts_96860_103090_" > simply be a sign of exhaustion after a long day of childcare or work at the office. Sometimes,</a><a name="ts_103090_110200_" > an untouched hand is just an untouched hand. The real problem in the ambiguous darkness</a><a name="ts_110200_117180_" > of the bedroom is not a lack of reciprocation per se. It is the way that that ambiguity is</a><a name="ts_117180_124040_" > interpreted. The way that assumptions are formed without discussion and grave offences taken without</a><a name="ts_124040_131680_" > the topic having first been aired. Beneath this lies a more pernicious problem still – shame.</a><a name="ts_131680_132850_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_132850_137970_" > Unreciprocated touch becomes properly dangerous when it comes into contact with a high degree</a><a name="ts_137970_144910_" > of self-suspicion or self-hatred on the part of the person who has dared to slide their hand</a><a name="ts_144910_151410_" > across. What might merely have been judged an innocent or temporary lack of enthusiasm comes</a><a name="ts_151410_158390_" > to be taken silently and automatically as evidence of something far more catastrophic, proof that</a><a name="ts_158390_166060_" > the other person finds us disgusting. Ideally, if we all loved ourselves enough, we would know</a><a name="ts_166060_172640_" > better what to do when we moved a hand across and didn&#x27;t get much in return. We would address</a><a name="ts_172640_179460_" > the matter within the couple through calm and kindly discussion and try to determine what is</a><a name="ts_179460_185320_" > at stake. If the evidence pointed squarely to an enduring lack of interest or emotional</a><a name="ts_185320_192070_" > capacity, we would leave. After all, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with ending up sharing a bed with</a><a name="ts_192070_198030_" > an emotionally or physically withholding partner. There is something very wrong, or at least very</a><a name="ts_198030_205210_" > unfortunate, with sticking around once one knows this is the case. But these are not the options</a><a name="ts_205210_213130_" > open to us when we feel overly ashamed. Our unresponsive partners reinforce pre-existing feelings of</a><a name="ts_213130_219950_" > unacceptability that render us bitter, mute and fragile. A history of not knowing how to</a><a name="ts_219950_226130_" > value ourselves makes it extremely difficult for us to complain effectively about unfortunate</a><a name="ts_226130_233550_" > treatment, let alone leave in order to seek warmer lovers elsewhere. As self-hating lovers,</a><a name="ts_233550_239730_" > we cannot say, with the requisite calm and strategic patience, that we feel rejected, that we need</a><a name="ts_239730_244650_" > to be understood and that we&#x27;re looking for change. We will either say nothing at all and</a><a name="ts_244650_250816_" > might have an affair or else explode into a rage that guarantees our message won&#x27;t be heard.</a><a name="ts_251456_256790_" > In the tensions around unreciprocated touch in the bedroom, we catch sight of a more general</a><a name="ts_256790_262730_" > problem in love. The difficulties created when we aren&#x27;t able to ask for what we want in</a><a name="ts_262730_268390_" > a relationship, when we suffer from a sense that we don&#x27;t deserve to be happy and cannot</a><a name="ts_268390_274590_" > handle frustration or respond to our misery adequately. We should not leave the untouched</a><a name="ts_274590_281690_" > hand for too long in the darkness. We should dare to switch on the light, express our pain and</a><a name="ts_281690_284768_" > consider our options without shame.</a></p></div></body>
