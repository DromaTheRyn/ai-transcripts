The calm, compassionate, wise center of you that</a><a name="ts_153430_154950_S01" > can listen to and lead your parts.</a><a name="ts_155210_158970_S01" > You&#x27;ll start to see your inner world with more compassion and clarity, and you might</a><a name="ts_158970_161970_S01" > even discover that every part has a good intention for you.</a><a name="ts_162250_168030_S01" > As you come to know your parts, and as you come to gain more connection with yourself, you</a><a name="ts_168030_171690_S01" > might come to see that each part has good intentions for you.</a><a name="ts_171770_173170_S01" > But first we have to get to know them.</a><a name="ts_173190_175130_S01" > So let&#x27;s start mapping your parts.</a><a name="ts_175230_181610_S01" > This exercise is adapted from Richard Schwartz&#x27;s book, No Bad Parts, and it&#x27;s a way of drawing</a><a name="ts_181610_185210_S01" > your inner system so you can understand it better and create more inner peace.</a><a name="ts_185370_188830_S01" > Okay, so for this exercise, you&#x27;ll want a pencil and paper.</a><a name="ts_188990_194330_S01" > Or if your overachiever part is allowed, you can use a different colored pen to represent</a><a name="ts_194330_194850_S01" > each part.</a><a name="ts_194930_199790_S01" > And this exercise is going to invite you to explore some of your inner feelings, and that</a><a name="ts_199790_201550_S01" > can bring up intense emotions sometimes.</a><a name="ts_201550_206750_S01" > So it&#x27;s always a good idea to do this work with a therapist, but a lot of people just can&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_206750_207590_S01" > access therapy.</a><a name="ts_207590_210530_S01" > be, so you might be left doing this exercise on your own.</a><a name="ts_210590_216090_S01" > If at any time you feel overwhelmed, feel free to take a break and do some kind of soothing</a><a name="ts_216090_216530_S01" > activity.</a><a name="ts_216530_221010_S01" > You can always come back to mapping your parts later when you&#x27;re feeling more resourced.</a><a name="ts_221150_222670_S01" > Okay, so let&#x27;s begin.</a><a name="ts_222830_227990_S01" > Think of a recent time where you felt stressed or anxious or conflicted.</a><a name="ts_228090_230850_S01" > What voices or feelings showed up inside of you?</a><a name="ts_230950_235330_S01" > So for example, maybe a worried part was predicting disaster.</a><a name="ts_235330_239910_S01" > A perfectionistic part was pushing you to do more, or a playful part wanted you to ignore</a><a name="ts_239910_240350_S01" > the problem.</a><a name="ts_240450_241410_S01" > These are all parts.</a><a name="ts_241670_243990_S01" > Now we&#x27;re going to start with just one part.</a><a name="ts_244530_246910_S01" > Notice where you experience this part.</a><a name="ts_247150_250010_S01" > It might come up as a sensation in your body.</a><a name="ts_250130_253270_S01" > It might come up as a thought or as an emotion.</a><a name="ts_253670_259090_S01" > And just stay focused on it long enough that you get a sense of it, that you could represent</a><a name="ts_259090_262930_S01" > that part of you on the page, and then go ahead and draw it.</a><a name="ts_262970_264830_S01" > Now it does not have to be a masterpiece.</a><a name="ts_265030_266752_S01" > Any kind of image is just fine.</a><a name="ts_266752_268416_S01" > (..)</a></p><p ><a name="ts_268416_270510_S00" >S00: Mine&#x27;s wearing those shoes.</a><a

>S01: Okay, now you can go ahead and give it, like, a short name.</a><a name="ts_277810_280890_S01" > You could name it, like, the worrier, the critic, the helper, the rebel.</a><a name="ts_281070_282410_S01" > These are examples of parts.</a><a name="ts_282670_285230_S01" > And these pictures do not need to be detailed.</a><a name="ts_285230_286570_S01" > They don&#x27;t need to be perfect.</a><a name="ts_286570_289070_S01" > Just spend a minute getting to know this part.</a><a name="ts_289270_294490_S01" > You&#x27;ll probably have to pause the video to do this work, and then go ahead and hit play</a></p><p ><a name="ts_294490_295392_S00" >S00: again when you&#x27;re ready.</a><a name="ts_295392_304032_S00" > (.........)</a></p><p ><a name="ts_304032_306510_S01" >S01: Now if you&#x27;re like me, some of these parts are not my favorite.</a><a name="ts_306870_312270_S01" > You might have a reaction where you feel disgust or anger or fear about this part.</a><a name="ts_312650_317910_S01" > Now this is not your true self, but it&#x27;s another part that has a difficult relationship with</a><a name="ts_317910_318130_S01" > it.</a><a name="ts_318230_321970_S01" > So for me, the first part that showed up was my anxious fixer.</a><a name="ts_322230_328390_S01" > And then the second one that showed up was the perfectionist, who is just, like,</a><a name="ts_329030_333410_S01" > meh, fake little smile, perfect little face, little wave.</a><a name="ts_334050_335296_S01" > We&#x27;ll call her the judgy.</a><a name="ts_335296_337650_S01" > (..)</a><a name="ts_337650_338490_S01" > Scrupulous person.</a><a name="ts_338930_348100_S01" > Now, some parts of me do not like the perfectionist, because she fights with the parts that want to</a><a name="ts_348100_352120_S01" > be fun, or kind, or cool, or chill.</a><a name="ts_352120_356864_S01" > (.....)</a><a name="ts_356864_358464_S01" > I was laying in a hammock being chill.</a><a name="ts_358464_364736_S01" > (......)</a><a name="ts_364736_358464_S01" > Look.</a><a name="ts_358464_365664_S01" > (.......)</a><a name="ts_365664_366570_S01" > So these guys are fighting.</a><a name="ts_366570_370208_S01" > (....)</a><a name="ts_370208_371550_S01" > That&#x27;s one of the cool things about this exercise.</a><a name="ts_371550_373390_S01" > We&#x27;re not making the parts get along.</a><a name="ts_373710_375872_S01" > Right now we&#x27;re just giving each part a name and getting to know it.</a><a name="ts_376416_380450_S01" > And then you can spend some time getting curious about each of these parts.</a><a name="ts_380730_383210_S01" > You could ask the part, what do you want?</a><a name="ts_383450_385210_S01" > What are you trying to protect me from?</a><a name="ts_385370_388128_S01" > Or what are you afraid would happen if you didn&#x27;t do your job?</a><a name="ts_388768_389990_S01" > You could write down these answers.</a><a name="ts_390410_394530_S01" > Even harsh or sabotaging parts usually have a protective intention.</a><a name="ts_394530_399370_S01" > So, for me, I asked my little perfectionist those questions, and then I just listened</a><a name="ts_399370_405790_S01" > with curiosity and compassion, imagining that scared little perfectionist as if it were an</a><a name="ts_405790_408010_S01" > actual person who I cared about.</a><a name="ts_408310_410610_S01" > Now, in IFS, each part is serving a role.</a><a name="ts_410690_412450_S01" > It&#x27;s trying to help you in some way.</a><a name="ts_412530_417490_S01" > So can you be curious or compassionate as you ask them what they&#x27;re trying to do for you?</a><a name="ts_417490_423328_S01" > Okay, go ahead and pause the video and spend a minute asking your part this question.</a><a name="ts_423328_431840_S01" > (.........)</a><a name="ts_431840_436460_S01" > Now, as I sat with my perfectionistic part, and as you notice your part, and as you treat</a><a name="ts_436460_440220_S01" > it with kindness, you&#x27;re tapping into that deeper self I mentioned earlier.</a><a name="ts_440220_442500_S01" > The self is the part who does the noticing.</a><a name="ts_442840_447040_S01" > It&#x27;s the self who leads and guides and listens to and comforts each of the parts.</a><a name="ts_447320_448840_S01" > The self is already whole.</a><a name="ts_449100_452700_S01" > You can feel it as you tap into this deeper self.</a><a name="ts_452800_454640_S01" > It&#x27;s already compassionate.</a><a name="ts_454820_456140_S01" > It&#x27;s already calm.</a><a name="ts_456340_460860_S01" > And so you can go ahead if you&#x27;d like and draw your capital S self on the paper.</a><a name="ts_460960_466590_S01" > And then from a place of self, you can go back into being curious about that part of you</a></p><p ><a name="ts_466590_469760_S00" >S00: that came up earlier and just listen to it for a minute.</a><a name="ts_469760_478464_S00" > (.........)</a><a name="ts_478464_480950_S00" > Okay, now you might notice a second part coming in.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_481050_482770_S01" >S01: I&#x27;ve got three parts on my paper already.</a><a name="ts_483410_486070_S01" > Notice where you feel that part in your body.</a><a name="ts_486290_490370_S01" > You might feel a shift coming on, a different set of thoughts or feelings, and go ahead and</a><a name="ts_490370_491488_S01" > draw that part as well.</a><a name="ts_492128_495136_S01" > Spend a moment getting to know this new part that is shown up.</a><a name="ts_495840_497590_S01" > You could draw something to represent it.</a><a name="ts_497970_500150_S01" > You know, sometimes our parts don&#x27;t show up as people.</a><a name="ts_500390_507570_S01" > They just show up as like a voice or a feeling in your body.</a><a name="ts_507790_508710_S01" > Give it a name.</a><a name="ts_509472_511540_S01" > Write down a few of the things it says or feels.</a><a name="ts_511540_514590_S01" > And notice what it feels like in your body.</a><a name="ts_514790_517110_S01" > And then allow yourself to shift to another part.</a><a name="ts_517210_522150_S01" > You can repeat this process until you feel like you&#x27;ve mapped out three to five parts within</a><a name="ts_522150_522410_S01" > you.</a><a name="ts_523010_526016_S01" > And again, pause the video and then restart it when you&#x27;re ready.</a><a name="ts_526016_534592_S01" > (.........)</a></p><p ><a name="ts_534592_537190_S00" >S00:

of garlic cloves.</a><a name="ts_545590_550816_S01" > Now, there might be other clusters within you, but today we&#x27;re just going to spend time with this cluster for now.</a><a name="ts_551424_558592_S01" > Go ahead and take that piece of paper, hold it at arm&#x27;s length, and ask yourself, like, how do these parts relate to each other?</a><a name="ts_559136_560060_S01" > Do some of them protect?</a><a name="ts_560620_561640_S01" > Do some of them fight?</a><a name="ts_561840_562460_S01" > Do they get along?</a><a name="ts_562980_564060_S01" > Are there teams?</a><a name="ts_564160_566368_S01" > Like, the two of them team up against the other.</a><a name="ts_566976_572350_S01" > You could draw, like, lines or circles to represent, like, an alliance.</a><a name="ts_572350_574208_S01" > (..)</a><a name="ts_574208_575190_S01" > These guys are friends.</a><a name="ts_575190_581230_S01" > And then call on your capital S self and practice being an observer in this system.</a><a name="ts_582208_586930_S01" > When we&#x27;re blended with each part, we might feel angry or disgusted or scared of some of our parts.</a><a name="ts_587030_590170_S01" > And like any family, your parts might fight or let each other down.</a><a name="ts_590330_593410_S01" > So you could ask your parts, how do they feel about each part?</a><a name="ts_593710_596950_S01" > You could ask yourself, what does this little family system need from me?</a><a name="ts_597070_600670_S01" > And again, each time we do this, we gain a little perspective.</a><a name="ts_600670_602650_S01" > We separate from our parts a little bit.</a><a name="ts_602650_608736_S01" > When we do this, we&#x27;re freeing ourself to act from a place of curiosity and compassion and calm.</a><a name="ts_609280_613280_S01" > When you take the time to step back and connect and listen, you&#x27;ll find that trust and harmony will grow,</a><a name="ts_613480_616900_S01" >

In the hope that it&#x27;s helpful, I&#x27;ll share one of the interactions that happened for me.</a><a name="ts_652660_658340_S01" > So I started by thinking about a stressful moment, our morning routine, trying to get the kids out to</a><a name="ts_658340_664600_S01" > school, and I recognized my little perfectionist part. So myself said, hello, perfectionist part.</a><a name="ts_664940_670580_S01" > How are you today? The perfectionist says, I&#x27;m fine. I&#x27;m feeling small. I&#x27;m ready to be criticized.</a><a name="ts_670580_675340_S01" > And then the fixer says, oh, if you work hard enough, you can probably fix yourself.</a><a name="ts_675680_681100_S01" > And the perfectionist is like, oh, I feel ashamed, right? She feels like, shame. Small.</a><a name="ts_681100_682944_S01" > (..)</a><a name="ts_682944_685660_S01" > And then the fixer says, you shouldn&#x27;t feel shame. You should feel hopeful.</a><a name="ts_686020_691920_S01" > And the perfectionist felt more shame. What&#x27;s the matter with me? I should know better.</a><a name="ts_692140_697180_S01" > I should be over this by now. And when I tapped into myself, I saw this little</a><a name="ts_697680_703360_S01" > shame-filled person inside of me. And I just felt to reach out to her and give her a little hug.</a><a name="ts_703580_709840_S01" > To say it&#x27;s human to have flaws, even flaws that hurt others. And I felt my perfectionist self crying</a><a name="ts_709840_714600_S01" > quietly. And then myself asked, what are you feeling right now? Do you feel bad?</a><a name="ts_715020_720120_S01" > The perfectionist said, I feel like I&#x27;m never good enough. And myself asked my judgy little</a><a name="ts_720120_725080_S01" > perfectionist self, how old are you? And I saw that she was a very young seventh grader.</a><a name="ts_725080_732210_S01" > And then from myself, I said, that&#x27;s okay. I&#x27;m an old soul. I&#x27;m here to support you. I love you. Yes,</a><a name="ts_732410_739500_S01" > even you. Even as a judgy perfectionistic little punk. I love you. And you&#x27;re not alone anymore.</a><a name="ts_739720_746830_S01" > And as I did that, I just felt this healing happen. And this is how IFS works. Our self reaches out to</a><a name="ts_746830_754070_S01" > these parts, these managers and these firefighters, these exiles, and extends this healing love and</a><a name="ts_754070_760030_S01" > compassion. And for me, it created this shift of gentleness toward myself. And my judgy,</a><a name="ts_760110_765190_S01" > perfectionistic part didn&#x27;t feel like it had to be so judgy anymore. One of the things you can ask</a><a name="ts_765190_771080_S01" > your parts is like, if you weren&#x27;t being so judgy, what would you be instead? My judgy part would say,</a><a name="ts_771160_775720_S01" > I would be passionate about doing good in the world. And that part of me is beautiful. And I can,</a><a name="ts_775720_779880_S01" > I can extend love and compassion towards that part. And it actively creates healing inside of me.</a><a name="ts_779880_785860_S01" > So it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s helpful for you to give yourself time to process this exercise and get to know your</a><a name="ts_785860_791720_S01" > parts over the course of days or weeks. So I don&#x27;t recommend that you map all of your parts all at</a><a name="ts_791720_797120_S01" > once. You could just start with one or two of these parts at a time and spend time getting to know them.</a><a name="ts_797380_803440_S01" > You can take this little map that you&#x27;ve made and you can put it on your wall and spend time each</a><a name="ts_803440_809140_S01" > morning or evening doing like this little internal meditation dialogue where you talk to each of these</a><a name="ts_809140_813320_S01" > parts and get to know them. You can also save this video to your own mental health playlist in YouTube</a><a name="ts_813320_818780_S01" > or come back to this series I&#x27;m making and watch this video over and over again and see how you</a><a name="ts_818780_823020_S01" > learn and grow each time. I really appreciate that you&#x27;re here. I&#x27;m grateful that people like you are</a><a name="ts_823020_827780_S01" > breaking the cycles of generational trauma, working on your own healing so you can help heal the world.</a><a name="ts_827920_833020_S01" > And if you found this exercise helpful, I would really appreciate it if you would give it a thumbs up</a><a name="ts_833020_838976_S01" > or share it with someone who would benefit from it today. Thank you so much for watching and take care.</a></p></div></body>
