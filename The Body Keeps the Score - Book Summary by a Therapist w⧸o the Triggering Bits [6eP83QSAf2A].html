intimidated by the body keeps the score, and to be honest,</a><a name="ts_4170_4630_" > I was too.</a><a name="ts_4910_9430_" > It&#x27;s pretty long, it has a lot of triggering examples of real-life trauma, but it&#x27;s also</a><a name="ts_9430_13890_" > a great book for understanding how trauma affects the brain and body, and that&#x27;s probably</a><a name="ts_13890_17550_" > why it&#x27;s been on the New York Times bestseller list for like five years.</a><a name="ts_17810_23930_" > It&#x27;s also probably because trauma affects all of us, and the author, Dr. Bessel van der Kolk,</a><a name="ts_23970_27390_" > has written The Modern User&#x27;s Guide to Understanding Trauma.</a><a name="ts_27390_33890_" > There&#x27;s so much to talk about with trauma and PTSD, and the book is over 350 pages long.</a><a name="ts_34090_38730_" > So I&#x27;m going to summarize the essentials without the triggering bits, and you can download the</a><a name="ts_38730_40410_" > free PDF summary linked in the description.</a><a name="ts_40410_43808_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_43808_47820_" > Okay, so I&#x27;m excited to tell you what Dr. van der Kolk has learned about trauma treatments</a><a name="ts_47820_49580_" > that are surprisingly effective.</a><a name="ts_49700_55680_" > But first, let&#x27;s talk about the broad impacts that trauma has on the brain, the body, and</a><a name="ts_55680_56320_" > relationships.</a><a name="ts_56580_58940_" > And to do that, we&#x27;ve got to start with a basic question.</a><a name="ts_58940_61260_" > How would you define trauma?</a><a name="ts_61580_66720_" > Now, most of us think of it as an event that is deeply disturbing, but really, trauma is</a><a name="ts_66720_72680_" > about how different people might respond to the same event with either an adaptive response</a><a name="ts_72680_77580_" > or a traumatic response that gets the brain and body stuck reliving the trauma.</a><a name="ts_77740_83640_" > And that&#x27;s one of the defining parts of trauma, that it continues to affect a person in damaging</a><a name="ts_83640_84160_" > ways.</a><a name="ts_84540_89280_" > Van der Kolk says, trauma is not just an event that took place sometime in the past, it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_89280_93820_" > also the imprint left by that experience on mind, brain, and body.</a><a name="ts_94000_99580_" > This imprint has ongoing consequences for how the human organism manages to survive in the</a><a name="ts_99580_99860_" > present.</a><a name="ts_100220_106360_" > So while trauma may start with an event, the brain and body&#x27;s reaction can keep a person stuck</a><a name="ts_106360_107460_" > as time moves on.</a><a name="ts_107560_112400_" > Rather than live in the present, survivors focus their energy on suppressing the inner</a><a name="ts_112400_117100_" > chaos that arises when a trigger makes them remember and re-experience their past.</a><a name="ts_117420_120260_" > And that affects their relationships with people all around them.</a><a name="ts_120260_122500_" > I saw this several years ago with one of my neighbors.</a><a name="ts_122560_127100_" > We have a neighborhood Facebook group where people ask to borrow stuff or post about lost</a><a name="ts_127100_129220_" > pets, basically anything a neighbor can help with.</a><a name="ts_129360_133680_" > And one year around the 4th of July, a war veteran neighbor posted a request.</a><a name="ts_133900_139320_" > He planned to escape to the quiet of the mountains for the 4th of July to avoid the fireworks that</a><a name="ts_139320_139560_" > night.</a><a name="ts_139560_145960_" > But he asked if we could all please just not set off any fireworks for the days around the holiday.</a><a name="ts_145960_151020_" > And he said that each time these unexpected fireworks went off, he would hit the floor</a><a name="ts_151020_152940_" > and he would see desert palm trees.</a><a name="ts_153120_157020_" > He&#x27;d feel like he was back in Iraq, hoping not to get hit by a mortar.</a><a name="ts_157160_158920_" > He was stuck in a survival response.</a><a name="ts_159240_161540_" > He said it was a very difficult week for him.</a><a name="ts_161640_163380_" > And I truly feel for him.</a><a name="ts_163480_166200_" > But can you also see how his trauma had him stuck?</a><a name="ts_166500_171340_" > He was asking his family to miss the holiday and asking our entire neighborhood to cut our celebrations</a><a name="ts_171340_172740_" > to accommodate his trauma.</a><a name="ts_173020_174500_" > Now, I get where he&#x27;s coming from.</a><a name="ts_174500_175820_" > I&#x27;m not judging.</a><a name="ts_176040_177760_" > I&#x27;m just saying this was impacting him.</a><a name="ts_178140_181120_" > Trauma is not just a mental or emotional problem.</a><a name="ts_181120_182860_" > It affects the whole person.</a><a name="ts_183020_187000_" > So let&#x27;s look at the three places that trauma lives on in its survivors.</a><a name="ts_187300_191120_" > Trauma in the brain, trauma in the body, and trauma in relationships.</a><a name="ts_191120_193632_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_193632_199420_" > Okay, so to understand what happens in traumatized brains, it&#x27;s helpful to know that the brain has</a><a name="ts_199420_202660_" > to simplify three sections that respond to trauma differently.</a><a name="ts_202900_206060_" > The brainstem, which some people think of as the reptilian brain.</a><a name="ts_206060_208760_" > It&#x27;s in charge of survival functions and reflexes.</a><a name="ts_208860_212480_" > The limbic system, it manages emotions and social behavior.</a><a name="ts_212680_215000_" > This is where the fight-flight-freeze response is triggered.</a><a name="ts_215420_217580_" > And then number three is the prefrontal cortex.</a><a name="ts_217580_220440_" > It takes care of rational thinking and decision-making.</a><a name="ts_220660_225060_" > This is the part of the brain that we would normally consider as the thinking part of the brain.</a><a name="ts_225060_226580_" > And it helps us manage our lives.</a><a name="ts_226700_232980_" > But when danger is present, the prefrontal cortex shuts down and the reptilian brain springs to action,</a><a name="ts_233180_235020_" > kicking us into fight, flight, or freeze.</a><a name="ts_235280_238920_" > Now, when fight, flight, or freeze has worked and we&#x27;ve escaped that danger,</a><a name="ts_239100_241260_" > we can go back to our normal brain function.</a><a name="ts_241480_245940_" > The body&#x27;s part in a dangerous situation is to run, to scream, to fight back,</a><a name="ts_246140_248100_" > or to take some other action against the threat.</a><a name="ts_248100_251120_" > And then the brain knows that that threat has been handled.</a><a name="ts_251280_256960_" > But when we can&#x27;t fight back or escape, the body&#x27;s last attempt to create safety is to shut down.</a><a name="ts_257140_261940_" > And this can happen in a war zone, a car accident, or assault, when running away isn&#x27;t possible.</a><a name="ts_262120_266260_" > As Van der Kolk says, immobilization is at the root of most traumas.</a><a name="ts_266380_271120_" > Being unable to do anything about what is happening is what makes the event traumatic.</a><a name="ts_271120_275760_" > With the freeze and the shutdown response, the parasympathetic nervous system takes over,</a><a name="ts_275900_279940_" > which causes a slower heart rate, shallow breathing, a loss of muscle tone.</a><a name="ts_280180_283480_" > You might feel numb, detached, or some people faked.</a><a name="ts_283860_288620_" > More frequently, people dissociate and they find themselves separating from their feelings</a><a name="ts_288620_293800_" > or watching the abuse as an event or an observer, like it&#x27;s happening to someone else.</a><a name="ts_293940_298900_" > So as part of the shutdown response to trauma, some people experience depersonalization,</a><a name="ts_298900_302060_" > which is when a person loses their sense of self.</a><a name="ts_302220_305160_" > They feel like they are separated from their body.</a><a name="ts_305460_309120_" > Researchers in the Netherlands scanned the brains of trauma survivors and saw that</a><a name="ts_309120_314180_" > fear centers in the brain simply shut down when they recall their traumatic event.</a><a name="ts_314540_319360_" > Now, shutdown is one of the ways the brain protects itself, but you can&#x27;t selectively numb.</a><a name="ts_319540_324040_" > So getting stuck in a chronic freeze or shutdown state leaves people feeling numb or detached</a><a name="ts_324040_325660_" > in many areas of their lives.</a><a name="ts_325660_331840_" > This might look like burnout at work or disconnected relationships or just a general loss of joy</a><a name="ts_331840_332440_" > in life.</a><a name="ts_332620_337980_" > Being able to take action, whether during the event or after the trauma, as part of your</a><a name="ts_337980_341500_" > healing process, can help victims restore their sense of wholeness.</a><a name="ts_341760_345300_" > Okay, so that&#x27;s how that fight-flight-freeze response can get stuck.</a><a name="ts_345460_347240_" > Sometimes people get stuck in shutdown response.</a><a name="ts_347360_349960_" > Sometimes people get stuck in that fight-or-flight response.</a><a name="ts_349960_353580_" > They maybe are really angry or really scared all the time.</a><a name="ts_353580_356260_" > And that&#x27;s the nervous system reaction to trauma.</a><a name="ts_356400_361660_" > So that&#x27;s one of the ways trauma gets stored in the nervous system, which includes the</a><a name="ts_361660_361880_" > brain.</a><a name="ts_362240_366540_" > Okay, trauma also impacts the victim&#x27;s ability to store and retrieve memories.</a><a name="ts_366840_371200_" > Some memories get stuck as vibrant and as real as the day they happen.</a><a name="ts_371540_374300_" > And other memories can be repressed for years or decades.</a><a name="ts_374520_377660_" > And memory loss is a really common symptom of trauma.</a><a name="ts_377660_382760_" > When trauma is unresolved, after the event is over, the lower brain doesn&#x27;t know that</a><a name="ts_382760_386380_" > it can stop telling the body to escape a threat that is now gone.</a><a name="ts_386540_391420_" > So it&#x27;s going to continue to secrete stress hormones, especially when something triggers</a><a name="ts_391420_393120_" > the memory of that traumatic event.</a><a name="ts_393120_398820_" > And it could be years or decades after the trauma happened and the amygdala will still jump</a><a name="ts_398820_400220_" > into overreaction mode.</a><a name="ts_400340_401740_" > That is PTSD.</a><a name="ts_402320_403960_" > Now, military veterans deal with this.</a><a name="ts_403960_407420_" > Their rational brain knows when they&#x27;re home, the war is over.</a><a name="ts_407600_411700_" > But any trigger can jumpstart that lower brain, that survival brain.</a><a name="ts_411840_416000_" > And this all happens beneath the reasoning of the more evolved part of the brain.</a><a name="ts_416180_418540_" > And this is not a failing of willpower.</a><a name="ts_418880_424340_" > Their amygdala is stuck on constant high alert and harmless situations can trigger their survival</a><a name="ts_424340_426620_" > brain to fight, flee, or freeze.</a><a name="ts_426780_430740_" > Sometimes all at once as the thinking brain tries to stay in control.</a><a name="ts_430740_435560_" > And this can result in panic, rage attack, or terrified cowering.</a><a name="ts_435720_441100_" > People with PTSD frequently experience flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and emotional numbing.</a><a name="ts_441220_446260_" > And these symptoms just get in the way of maintaining relationships and holding jobs and living normal</a><a name="ts_446260_446720_" > lives.</a><a name="ts_447020_447840_" > Van der Kolk says,</a><a name="ts_447840_453080_" > Trauma results in a fundamental reorganization of the way mind and brain manage perceptions.</a><a name="ts_453220_459100_" > It changes not only how we think and what we think about, but also our very capacity to think.</a><a name="ts_459360_464180_" > Now, the author likes the Rorschach test as a way of seeing how his patients think differently</a><a name="ts_464180_465920_" > than non-traumatized people.</a><a name="ts_465960_468300_" > You&#x27;ve probably heard of these inkblots before.</a><a name="ts_468300_473920_" > Because this test is all about what a person draws from the inkblot, the test can&#x27;t be</a><a name="ts_473920_478980_" > faked, the patient is asked what meaning he sees in each inkblot.</a><a name="ts_479100_483980_" > So, for example, most people say this looks like a bat or a butterfly or a moth.</a><a name="ts_484060_489880_" > But a traumatized person might see something that is broken or ruined or some sort of aggressive</a><a name="ts_489880_490340_" > act.</a><a name="ts_490460_493100_" > Or they might not be able to imagine anything at all.</a><a name="ts_493100_498180_" > Van der Kolk says that traumatized people have a tendency to superimpose their trauma</a><a name="ts_498180_499840_" > on everything around them.</a><a name="ts_499980_502840_" > So, an innocuous comment might feel like an attack.</a><a name="ts_503160_505780_" > Or an article of clothing might elicit intense shame.</a><a name="ts_505980_509220_" > Or the smell of food might trigger an intense fear response.</a><a name="ts_509380_514040_" > Louis Zamperini from the book Unbroken describes how a waiter once brought him white rice and he</a><a name="ts_514040_519320_" > flew into a rage because it triggered memories of his time in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.</a><a name="ts_519640_522656_" > So, PTSD disintegrates your sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_522656_525056_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_525056_529180_" > Most people don&#x27;t think of trauma as being anything beyond a mental health issue, which</a><a name="ts_529180_534480_" > is probably why the book&#x27;s title is A Good Wake Up Call, because this is a whole body response.</a><a name="ts_534740_539560_" > The amygdala is going to keep triggering a survival response even when it&#x27;s not needed.</a><a name="ts_539560_545020_" > The body keeps sending out these stress hormones long after the traumatic danger has passed.</a><a name="ts_545200_552020_" > So, over time, being in a near constant state of stress affects memory, attention, sleep, mood,</a><a name="ts_552020_553680_" > and physiological health.</a><a name="ts_553940_560620_" > Physical symptoms of unresolved trauma include obesity or rapid weight gain or weight loss,</a><a name="ts_560800_566760_" > anorexia, chronic back and neck pain, migraines, some types of asthma, digestive problems, spastic</a><a name="ts_566760_572640_" > colon, IBS, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and other autoimmune diseases, plus a bunch of other</a><a name="ts_572640_577480_" > conditions like cardiovascular conditions and other autoimmune diseases.</a><a name="ts_577480_582960_" > Being under constant stress from past or present trauma also makes a person vulnerable to</a><a name="ts_582960_584920_" > depression, heart disease, and cancer.</a><a name="ts_585120_589780_" > Many trauma survivors become addicted to numbing behaviors, including overeating, anorexia,</a><a name="ts_589960_592800_" > addiction to exercise or work, drugs, or alcohol.</a><a name="ts_593020_599320_" > And then some do the opposite and seek sensations that will overpower those anxious feelings in their</a><a name="ts_599320_599720_" > body.</a><a name="ts_599860_604620_" > So, these people might try high-risk activities like risky sex, gambling, bungee jumping, bullet</a><a name="ts_604620_605900_" > biking, things like that.</a><a name="ts_605900_608640_" > Now, for some people, trauma has the opposite effect.</a><a name="ts_608660_614880_" > As a defense mechanism, the brain will stop registering terrifying sensation, but it can&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_614880_615740_" > selectively numb.</a><a name="ts_615740_619000_" > So, it&#x27;s going to compromise all bodily sensations.</a><a name="ts_619000_621020_" > And this is called a depersonalization.</a><a name="ts_621240_623900_" > The sensory perceptions are just on.</a><a name="ts_624080_628840_" > So, these patients stop being able to feel whole parts of their bodies.</a><a name="ts_629120_633000_" > Imagine that someone blindfolded you and handed you an object to identify.</a><a name="ts_633000_638640_" > Most people would be able to identify a car key or a corridor or a can opener with their</a><a name="ts_638640_639260_" > eyes closed.</a><a name="ts_639480_645320_" > But people with PTSD often can&#x27;t put together the sensations of the object&#x27;s weight, shape,</a><a name="ts_645460_646040_" > and texture.</a><a name="ts_646320_651340_" > Their brain can&#x27;t integrate the senses coming from their body, and they can&#x27;t guess what</a><a name="ts_651340_652100_" > object they&#x27;re holding.</a><a name="ts_652340_656300_" > So, what do you think happens when the brain and body aren&#x27;t able to connect and integrate?</a><a name="ts_656300_658100_" > You can&#x27;t feel fully alive.</a><a name="ts_658100_663060_" > You don&#x27;t feel physical sensations like pleasure or pain, and this leads to losing your sense</a><a name="ts_663060_665920_" > of purpose and direction, even your sense of self.</a><a name="ts_666200_670380_" > And in severe cases, traumatized patients can&#x27;t even recognize themselves in a mirror.</a><a name="ts_670560_675300_" > Whether a trauma survivor experiences chronic pain and illness or numbness, they aren&#x27;t able</a><a name="ts_675300_680000_" > to feel anything, it&#x27;s important for doctors and therapists to be able to see that trauma</a><a name="ts_680000_681780_" > might be at the root of what&#x27;s going on.</a><a name="ts_681860_687200_" > In that case, these physical problems won&#x27;t heal unless a person faces their traumatic past</a><a name="ts_687200_690860_" > in a way that lets their body heal along with their mind.</a><a name="ts_690940_694840_" > And I promise we&#x27;re going to get to many of the options for healing, but first, I&#x27;m just</a><a name="ts_694840_698200_" > going to quickly summarize what the book said about trauma in relationships.</a><a name="ts_698240_701940_" > It makes sense that trauma almost always gets in the way of intimate relationships.</a><a name="ts_701940_707720_" > After all, if you were a soldier causing violence in a war or a victim receiving violence through</a><a name="ts_707720_711980_" > abuse, the trauma makes it very hard to trust oneself or someone else.</a><a name="ts_712100_714880_" > But a lack of trust is not the only issue at play here.</a><a name="ts_715060_719660_" > The book shares some of the research done by Dr. Ruth Lainus, and she researched how brains</a><a name="ts_719660_723000_" > react to social situations, and she found something really amazing.</a><a name="ts_723160_728340_" > For someone who has not experienced trauma, when someone attempts to make eye contact with them</a><a name="ts_728340_732960_" > and the prefrontal cortex is activated, they become curious about the other person.</a><a name="ts_733220_737560_" > Their mirror neurons pick up on the person&#x27;s intentions, and the thinking part of the brain</a><a name="ts_737560_740320_" > works through whether this person is safe or not.</a><a

periaqueductal gray area lights up and</a><a name="ts_751800_754280_" > it generates these self-protective behaviors.</a><a name="ts_754280_759140_" > In survival mode, when meeting strangers, a PTSD

around other people.</a><a name="ts_765500_770560_" > And when we look at people who had childhood trauma, more than half of them also had learning</a><a name="ts_770560_774520_" > or behavioral problems in school, and they didn&#x27;t outgrow the problems.</a><a name="ts_774860_779020_" > And instead, they just learned to hide them with secrecy or shame.</a><a name="ts_779200_784140_" > So

going to move into the part about how to treat trauma, how to heal from trauma.</a><a name="ts_798240_803640_" > But before we do that, it&#x27;s super important to say that the majority of trauma can be prevented.</a><a name="ts_803640_805220_" > Vandercook says,</a><a name="ts_805440_810680_" > Child abuse and neglect is the single most preventable cause of mental illness, the single</a><a name="ts_810680_816240_" > most common cause of drug and alcohol abuse, and a significant contributor to leading causes</a><a name="ts_816240_821400_" > of death like diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and suicide.</a><a name="ts_821400_825860_" > Now, I made another video about the ACEs study, but I&#x27;m just going to summarize it real quick</a><a name="ts_825860_826860_" > because it&#x27;s so important.</a><a name="ts_827160_831960_" > ACE is short for Adverse Childhood Experiences, and this includes observing or experiencing abuse,</a><a name="ts_831960_836840_" > neglect, neglect, domestic violence, or losing a parent to death or divorce or incarceration.</a><a name="ts_837100_839760_" > The groundbreaking ACEs study found two things.</a><a name="ts_839960_845700_" > Number one, a massive percentage, 64% of people experience at least one ACE in their life,</a><a name="ts_845820_851600_" > and 16%, that&#x27;s one in six people, experience four or more ACEs.</a><a name="ts_851760_857200_" > And secondly, these ACEs have a massive impact on physical and mental health for the rest of your</a><a name="ts_857200_857480_" > life.</a><a name="ts_857480_862560_" > Kids who experience four to six traumatic events are up to five times as likely to have</a><a name="ts_862560_863380_" > chronic depression.</a><a name="ts_863780_866500_" > Suicide attempts are 5,000

better place by being trauma-informed and working to raise kids</a><a name="ts_950080_951580_" > in supportive, safe families.</a><a name="ts_951920_953340_" > So, thank you for being here.</a><a name="ts_953460_955140_" > Now we&#x27;re going to move on to healing.</a><a name="ts_955400_955760_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_955760_960000_" > So, because trauma gets stuck in the body, the body must be treated along with the mind</a><a name="ts_960000_964660_" > so it can release the emotions it is held onto in the form of disease, bad habits, or</a><a name="ts_964660_965600_" > reactive behaviors.</a><a name="ts_965960_966460_" > Two things.</a><a name="ts_966620_970040_" > So, as we get ready to talk about healing trauma, it&#x27;s helpful to understand what that</a><a name="ts_970040_970480_" > looks like.</a><a name="ts_970600_973780_" > There are basically two ways to know when trauma has been healed.</a><a name="ts_974100_978120_" > Number one, you don&#x27;t rely on trauma-related coping strategies anymore.</a><a name="ts_978120_983580_" > You feel safe enough that these self-protective behaviors or compulsions or panic attacks or</a><a name="ts_983580_987760_" > rage attacks or substance abuse or numbing behaviors or self-destructive behaviors and</a><a name="ts_987760_992060_" > passivity, you feel safe enough that you&#x27;re not doing these behaviors anymore.</a><a name="ts_992400_992700_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_992880_997640_" > The second thing that shows that you&#x27;re healed from or healing on the right path to healing</a><a name="ts_997640_1003480_" > from trauma is that you&#x27;re able to integrate both your memories and your body&#x27;s sensations.</a><a name="ts_1003500_1008000_" > You can have memories come up in your mind or sensations in your body and you make space</a><a name="ts_1008120_1010040_" > for them and you can calm yourself.</a><a name="ts_1010040_1014900_" > You can remember the past while staying here in your body, in the present.</a><a name="ts_1015220_1015360_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_1015520_1018820_" > There are three main ways to address and reverse the damage of trauma.</a><a name="ts_1019260_1023780_" > Number one, taking medication to dial down some PTSD symptoms so that you can work through</a><a name="ts_1023780_1024000_" > them.</a><a name="ts_1024340_1028320_" > And then number two, working top-down through talk therapy, reasoning, and connecting with</a><a name="ts_1028320_1028540_" > others.</a><a name="ts_1028760_1033720_" > And then number three, working bottom-up by calming the body&#x27;s physical sensations and letting</a><a name="ts_1033720_1040180_" > it have those visceral experiences and the safe visceral experiences that contradict the</a><a name="ts_1040180_1041100_" > emotions of trauma.</a><a name="ts_1041280_1048840_" > We experience emotions in the physical heart, in our torso, in our gut, in our muscles.</a><a name="ts_1049160_1053740_" > So instead of accessing those stuck emotions through the brain&#x27;s cognition, treatment needs</a><a name="ts_1053740_1057480_" > to address emotions like anger and fear and resolve them through the body.</a><a name="ts_1057480_1059740_" > Most people need a combination of these options.</a><a name="ts_1060080_1063860_" > Some of the bottom-up options are well-known, but others might surprise you.</a><a name="ts_1064000_1067600_" > And it&#x27;s worth noting that Van der Kolk doesn&#x27;t have a favorite treatment method.</a><a name="ts_1067760_1072800_" > He practices all of the treatments discussed in this book, depending on the specifics of the</a><a name="ts_1072800_1075100_" > trauma and the person processing it.</a><a name="ts_1075160_1076540_" > I like to think of it as like a tool belt.</a><a name="ts_1076740_1078080_" > You don&#x27;t want just one tool.</a><a name="ts_1078260_1082920_" > You want to have a lot of types of tools that can manage a lot of different situations.</a><a name="ts_1083200_1083540_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_1083540_1084840_" > So let&#x27;s talk about medications.</a><a name="ts_1085200_1089700_" > Medication can be a powerful tool to help patients stay calm enough to revisit their</a><a name="ts_1089700_1093220_" > traumatic experiences so that the rational brain can integrate them.</a><a name="ts_1093320_1099900_" > Some medications like SSRI, ketamine, and psychedelics might even help the brain improve neuroplasticity.</a><a name="ts_1100000_1102980_" > This is the ability to adapt and learn and grow.</a><a name="ts_1103160_1106020_" > It&#x27;s important to acknowledge that medication doesn&#x27;t heal the trauma.</a><a name="ts_1106060_1112100_" > It&#x27;s a tool that helps dial down the intensity of our emotions so that we can do the work little</a><a name="ts_1112100_1114240_" > by little and process through the trauma.</a><a name="ts_1114420_1119780_" > The point is to eventually get the body grounded in the calm and safe present so that the brain</a><a name="ts_1119780_1122280_" > can revisit the past and work through it.</a><a name="ts_1122380_1127860_" > And then integrate it by letting the body take those fight or flight actions that it couldn&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_1127860_1129280_" > take during the event that caused them.</a><a name="ts_1129380_1134120_" > And then that&#x27;ll take you through that whole nervous system cycle to return to a sense of calm.</a><a name="ts_1134340_1139160_" > So when the author starts working with a patient, he helps them to first recognize the sensations</a><a name="ts_1139160_1144900_" > in their body. He wants them to recognize and name what anger or fear physically feel like.</a><a name="ts_1145040_1147460_" > So, for example, you might feel tingling or tense muscles.</a><a name="ts_1147460_1151720_" > You might feel your gut is churning or you may feel hollow inside.</a><a name="ts_1152020_1157300_" > He also helps them recognize and name like happy or relaxing or pleasurable sensations like,</a><a name="ts_1157440_1161520_" > oh, my muscles feel sleepy or my chest feels open.</a><a name="ts_1161900_1162120_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1162220_1164720_" > And this is this is a type of mindfulness exercise.</a><a name="ts_1164720_1167680_" > And this helps strengthen the medial prefrontal cortex.</a><a name="ts_1168280_1173540_" > So sensing, naming, and identifying what&#x27;s going on inside the body is the first step</a><a name="ts_1173540_1177880_" > to connecting the trauma in the mind and body to integrating it.</a><a name="ts_1178100_1178280_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_1178280_1183980_" > So let&#x27;s let&#x27;s explore this body centric trauma healing by going back to New York City in September</a><a name="ts_1183980_1184780_" > of 2001.</a><a name="ts_1185000_1190180_" > Knowing that people would need trauma therapy, the experts recommended that therapists primarily</a><a name="ts_1190180_1194520_" > use analytic talk therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy.</a><a name="ts_1194660_1196860_" > These were the gold standard treatments.</a><a name="ts_1197200_1197700_" > But guess what?</a><a name="ts_1197860_1200100_" > Almost no one showed up processions.</a><a name="ts_1200380_1205000_" > Dr. Spencer, who ran the psychiatry department at one of New York&#x27;s hospitals, was curious</a><a name="ts_1205000_1207680_" > what survivors had done instead to get help.</a><a name="ts_1207740_1211620_" > So he surveyed 225 people who had escaped from the Twin Towers.</a><a name="ts_1211820_1216280_" > And here&#x27;s a list in order of what survivors found to be the most helpful in overcoming the</a><a name="ts_1216280_1221980_" > trauma they&#x27;d experienced, acupuncture, massage, yoga, EMDR for rescue workers.</a><a name="ts_1222340_1223940_" > Massage was at the top of the list.</a><a name="ts_1224040_1227720_" > Would you have guessed that acupuncture or massage could treat trauma at the time?</a><a name="ts_1227880_1228620_" > Almost no one did.</a><a name="ts_1228840_1233180_" > Some other modalities that were helpful included free writing, art, music, and dance.</a><a name="ts_1233340_1237880_" > And these might all be really surprising to those of us in the Western world where the emphasis</a><a name="ts_1237880_1240000_" > is on science and intellect.</a><a name="ts_1240120_1245400_" > But in many other parts of the world, therapy includes physical movement, breathing and meditation.</a><a name="ts_1245400_1250900_" > So, for example, Tai Chi and Qigong in China, or rhythmic drumming in Africa, or martial</a><a name="ts_1250900_1254800_" > arts in Brazil and Japan and Korea, and yoga in India.</a><a name="ts_1255040_1256760_" > So let&#x27;s talk about yoga for a minute.</a><a name="ts_1256980_1261320_" > We know that healing happens when we integrate our current state of safety with our past bodily</a><a name="ts_1261320_1261740_" > memories.</a><a name="ts_1261980_1265500_" > Better breathing improves problems with anger, depression, and anxiety.</a><a name="ts_1265860_1271580_" > Yogis have a connection to their bodies in which they feel wholly alive and safe.</a><a name="ts_1271580_1276520_" > But as van der Kolk learned with his patients, yoga&#x27;s poses can at first feel really intense</a><a name="ts_1276520_1278100_" > or scary for trauma survivors.</a><a name="ts_1278340_1283000_" > So when using yoga therapy, he recommends that you just start really slowly and gently with</a><a name="ts_1283000_1285460_" > an instructor who&#x27;s trained in trauma-informed care.</a><a name="ts_1285460_1292960_" > So we know that healing happens when we integrate our current state of safety, like look around</a><a name="ts_1292960_1295240_" > you, the room you&#x27;re in, most likely safe.</a><a name="ts_1295240_1297720_" > If you&#x27;re watching this video, you&#x27;re pretty safe right now.</a><a name="ts_1297880_1303780_" > With, we integrate that current safety with our past bodily memories of trauma.</a><a name="ts_1304000_1308560_" > Because our sense of self is anchored to our bodies, we have to be in tune with our bodies,</a><a name="ts_1308560_1311180_" > not dissociated or numbing.</a><a name="ts_1311460_1315940_" > Yoga therapy helps patients get curious about what the body is telling them, rather than</a><a name="ts_1315940_1317920_" > resisting and fearing its sensations.</a><a name="ts_1318360_1323100_" > Practitioners focus on both their breath and bodily sensations while leaning into physical</a><a name="ts_1323100_1324080_" > stress and discomfort.</a><a name="ts_1324320_1329240_" > And then once they can breathe calmly and stay physically relaxed, survivors have the ability</a><a name="ts_1329240_1333600_" > to add in talk therapy to process in their horrifying memories without freezing out.</a><a name="ts_1333700_1337680_" > I&#x27;m going to include three websites down in the notes and also in that PDF download,</a><a name="ts_1337680_1341500_" > if you want, that the author recommends for yoga and mindfulness.</a><a name="ts_1342020_1346260_" > Okay, on to the next section of what helps trauma.</a><a name="ts_1346540_1349200_" > So I&#x27;ve explained what the book says about dissociation.</a><a name="ts_1349340_1356000_" > The author says that treatment for dissociation needs to include attunement and mirroring to help</a><a name="ts_1356000_1357420_" > the patient find his voice.</a><a name="ts_1357420_1361140_" > So that&#x27;s going to bring us to two treatment options that might not sound like therapy,</a><a name="ts_1361320_1362840_" > but they are surprisingly effective.</a><a name="ts_1363100_1365620_" > So the first is what Vanderkoek calls communal rhythms.</a><a name="ts_1365620_1370220_" > Basically, this is music in a group setting, and it&#x27;s great for teaching attunement.</a><a name="ts_1370360_1374700_" > Attunement is the ability to notice what&#x27;s going on with other people and to connect with them.</a><a name="ts_1374920_1379280_" > Rhythmic activities like drumming, dancing, and singing can help synchronize brain waves,</a><a name="ts_1379720_1383780_" > regulate the nervous system, and just promote this sense of unity and safety.</a><a name="ts_1384020_1388020_" > Anyone who&#x27;s been in a marching band or a dance troupe understands the unity that happens</a><a name="ts_1388020_1391000_" > when everyone attunes to the beat to create a great performance.</a><a name="ts_1391000_1394540_" > Okay, dramatic theater is another wonderful place to find one&#x27;s voice.</a><a name="ts_1394860_1399300_" > Vanderkoek describes how participating in theater can help trauma survivors work through</a><a name="ts_1399300_1400820_" > their emotion with scripts.</a><a name="ts_1401080_1406740_" > It allows them to feel deeply, but like in a controlled setting, so it doesn&#x27;t get out of control.</a><a name="ts_1407000_1410180_" > It&#x27;s like because they&#x27;re playing a role through someone else, there&#x27;s a buffer to help</a><a name="ts_1410180_1414320_" > tone down the intensity while still allowing them to process their trauma.</a><a name="ts_1414320_1418640_" > I think this is why a lot of us like to watch movies or read books that make us feel something,</a><a name="ts_1418820_1421260_" > because it helps us process our own emotions too.</a><a name="ts_1421440_1424840_" > While more research is needed to understand how theater can help with trauma healing,</a><a name="ts_1424960_1428720_" > Vanderkoek says it&#x27;s a pretty effective tool for trauma recovery.</a><a name="ts_1428860_1433880_" > And at the very least, he really strongly recommends that schools not cut programs like drama,</a><a name="ts_1434100_1437460_" > chorus, art, and PE that help kids who are dealing with trauma</a><a name="ts_1437460_1440740_" > stay connected to their bodies and their group of sick people.</a><a name="ts_1440740_1445240_" > Okay, on to the next treatment. You might have heard of EMDR, which is short for</a><a name="ts_1445240_1451420_" > eye movement, desensitization, and reprocessing. EMDR helps survivors process traumatic memories</a><a name="ts_1451420_1457480_" > to make them less distressing. The researchers believe that EMDR reproduces what happens in deep sleep.</a><a name="ts_1457740_1462940_" > During deep sleep, there&#x27;s a stage called REM, rapid eye movement. And while you&#x27;re sleeping,</a><a name="ts_1463080_1467520_" > your eyes literally move side to side like this. During this sleep stage,</a><a name="ts_1467520_1472840_" > the brain is processing memories and information from the day, but without intense emotions.</a><a name="ts_1472940_1479240_" > So it&#x27;s basically integrating those memories and filing them away. More time in REM sleep reduces</a><a name="ts_1479240_1483660_" > depression and helps people work through tough emotions. But unfortunately for people with PTSD,</a><a name="ts_1483880_1488480_" > those memories of trauma are often so intense that when their brain, when they&#x27;re sleeping,</a><a name="ts_1488620_1493340_" > when their brain is trying to process those memories and file them away, the memories instead come up</a><a name="ts_1493340_1499180_" > as intense nightmares with strong emotions. And then that wakes the person up, interrupts their sleep,</a><a name="ts_1499300_1503480_" > and interrupts the emotion processing. It&#x27;s like when you clean your room, sometimes it gets messier</a><a name="ts_1503480_1508620_" > before it gets cleaner. Having PTSD makes it so you get interrupted in the middle of cleaning your room</a><a name="ts_1508620_1514380_" > every time. And that mess just stays there and gets worse. So this is often what makes PTSD</a><a name="ts_1514380_1519780_" > memories and flashbacks worse. The creator of EMDR, Francine Shapiro, found that when she processed</a><a name="ts_1519780_1525420_" > painful memories during the day, while also moving her eyes side to side, those memories weren&#x27;t as painful</a><a name="ts_1525420_1531920_" > anymore. So she created a systematic treatment approach that helps PTSD patients use bilateral movement</a><a name="ts_1531920_1538640_" > to help them process through the memories. And now EMDR is one of the most effective evidence-based</a><a name="ts_1538640_1543000_" > treatments for PTSD. So this is not just woo-woo. They&#x27;ve run a ton of studies on EMDR.</a><a name="ts_1543000_1547580_" > They found it to be pretty darn effective. Okay. Oh, and the way it works is in therapy,</a><a name="ts_1547740_1552020_" > the patient recalls distressing events sometimes or brings up distressing memories. They don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_1552020_1556340_" > necessarily have to talk about it, but they&#x27;re doing some kind of bilateral movement, like watching</a><a name="ts_1556340_1561760_" > a moving light on a bar or tapping their hands on their legs. The patient doesn&#x27;t have to talk about</a><a name="ts_1561760_1567180_" > the details of the traumatic memory, but the patient might report what feelings or reactions come up</a><a name="ts_1567180_1572740_" > with the memory. And interestingly, EMDR can help even if the patient doesn&#x27;t fully trust the therapist.</a><a name="ts_1572740_1577380_" > One example in the body keeps the score was of a woman who was in a car accident and her young</a><a name="ts_1577380_1583140_" > daughter was killed. And despite trying talk therapy, she just was experiencing debilitating symptoms.</a><a name="ts_1583540_1589340_" > But after a few sessions of EMDR, like she no longer had PTSD. So research shows that EMDR</a><a name="ts_1589340_1595000_" > significantly decreases PTSD scores and it performs more effectively than a placebo or Prozac.</a><a name="ts_1595000_1600940_" > It cured 60% of patients and it decreased depression scores. But adults with a history</a><a name="ts_1600940_1605560_" > of childhood trauma or people who experienced repeated trauma instead of a single instance</a><a name="ts_1605560_1609960_" > do not respond as well to treatment. Okay, so that&#x27;s EMDR. Let&#x27;s talk about neurofeedback.</a><a name="ts_1610060_1614560_" > It&#x27;s another therapy that needs better research to know how to apply it, but its use for treating</a><a name="ts_1614560_1619680_" > trauma is pretty promising. In a neurofeedback session, a patient wears a cap or another device</a><a name="ts_1619680_1624420_" > with electrodes. And those electrodes measure your brainwaves. And then it works with a computer</a><a name="ts_1624420_1630180_" > so that you can get a little bit of feedback, which is like a little dopamine reward. So when</a><a name="ts_1630180_1636720_" > your brainwaves are calmer or healthier, like something good happens on the screen, whether that&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_1636720_1642020_" > one of the ones I used, it was like an arrow shot into the target when you were there, like you&#x27;re aiming</a><a name="ts_1642020_1645380_" > an arrow. Other times it just, it gives you other types of like feedback, like, good job,</a><a name="ts_1645380_1649500_" > you&#x27;re doing it. You know, you&#x27;re there, you&#x27;re in this, this brainwave pattern. And so basically</a><a name="ts_1649500_1654820_" > what this does is it trains the brain to relax and get good at making like a healthier brainwave</a><a name="ts_1654820_1659060_" > pattern. For patients with PTSD, their brain repeatedly fires circuits that keep them stuck</a><a name="ts_1659060_1663640_" > in fear, shame and rage. But if the patient&#x27;s brain can be trained to relax, they&#x27;re mentally</a><a name="ts_1663640_1668700_" > more resilient and they can work on integrating all the ways that trauma is recorded. The book shares</a><a name="ts_1668700_1673880_" > the story of a woman named Lisa, for whom neurofeedback was the key for her to heal from trauma.</a><a name="ts_1673880_1678580_" > Lisa had been abandoned by her father and physically tortured by her mother. As a teenager, she spent</a><a name="ts_1678580_1683940_" > time in mental hospital shelters, foster families, group homes, and living on the street to escape</a><a name="ts_1683940_1689760_" > her mother. As an adult, she was stuck in a dissociative state and talk therapy did nothing</a><a name="ts_1689760_1695580_" > but put her into a panic. When she started neurofeedback therapy, Dr. Seabren Fisher started by rewarding</a><a name="ts_1695580_1700480_" > the healthy brainwaves in the fear center of Lisa&#x27;s brain. And after a few weeks, Lisa noticed that</a><a name="ts_1700480_1705320_" > some of her constant fears dropped away and she was more relaxed around people.</a><a name="ts_1705820_1709520_" > And then after six months of treatment, she stopped dissociating and she started gaining</a><a name="ts_1709520_1713880_" > her sense of self. And I really love the way that she describes it. Let me show you.</a><a name="ts_1714000_1718300_" > I can now actually talk about the things like my childhood. For the first time, I started being</a><a name="ts_1718300_1723520_" > able to do therapy. Up till then, I couldn&#x27;t calm down enough. If you&#x27;re still in it, it&#x27;s hard to talk</a><a name="ts_1723520_1727460_" > about it. And I wasn&#x27;t able to attach in the way that you need to attach and open up in the way that</a><a name="ts_1727460_1732500_" > you need to in order to have any type of relationship with therapist. When explaining what life is like</a><a name="ts_1732500_1737800_" > for her after neurofeedback, she said, I&#x27;m not held hostage by my feelings. I&#x27;m not in fight or flight all</a><a name="ts_1737800_1742880_" > the time. Neurofeedback freed me to live my life the way I want to. And Lisa went on to graduate from</a><a name="ts_1742880_1747940_" > nursing school. And as of the publication date of this book, she worked as a nurse at a hospital.</a><a name="ts_1747940_1754060_" > Okay, the next type of therapy for PTSD is internal family systems therapy, or IFS. In the future,</a><a name="ts_1754180_1759100_" > I&#x27;m really hoping to make a video on this topic, but here&#x27;s a quick summary. IFS works with the idea</a><a name="ts_1759100_1764120_" > that we all have different parts inside of us. You might have a playful or adventurous part of you,</a><a name="ts_1764400_1769000_" > a short-tempered part of you, and a friendly and relaxed part of you. You might have a protector,</a><a name="ts_1769280_1775340_" > you might have a devious part of you. And basically, IFS is similar in that it calls the different parts of a</a><a name="ts_1775340_1781520_" > person&#x27;s personality, their internal family. Now, if this sounds familiar, that might be because the</a><a name="ts_1781520_1787160_" > movie Inside Out was based on this type of therapy. So for trauma survivors, their internal family parts</a><a name="ts_1787160_1794700_" > all work to hide or to manage the part that is hurt by trauma. In IFS therapy, the mindful self learns to</a><a name="ts_1794700_1800600_" > take charge. The mindful self is the calm, undamaged essence who can lead the other parts to healing</a><a name="ts_1800600_1805560_" > by taking care of them. And the other parts can come to trust that the self will handle things well.</a><a name="ts_1805680_1810700_" > And this creates self-compassion within the person. So the way the book puts it, the self is like an</a><a name="ts_1810700_1817740_" > orchestra conductor who helps all the parts to function harmoniously as a symphony rather than a cacophony.</a><a name="ts_1817940_1822200_" > And there&#x27;s plenty of research showing that IFS is an effective treatment for PTSD.</a><a name="ts_1822620_1825980_" > Okay, here&#x27;s another thing I think is really important. When it comes to trauma treatment,</a><a name="ts_1825980_1832420_" > people need to actively participate in their healing and not just be a passive patient accepting</a><a name="ts_1832420_1837680_" > medicine. Van der Kolk says, being a patient rather than a participant in one&#x27;s healing process</a><a name="ts_1837680_1843080_" > separates suffering people from their community and alienates them from an inner sense of self.</a><a name="ts_1843460_1848340_" > Healing from trauma is a process, not an event. And you&#x27;ll probably have to keep trying new things,</a><a name="ts_1848840_1853720_" > learning and growing through your experience rather than simply be healed by a single intervention.</a><a name="ts_1853720_1858760_" > This is why I think it&#x27;s important to educate yourself by watching videos by professionals</a><a name="ts_1858760_1863780_" > or reading good books like The Body Keeps the Score. Also, you just can&#x27;t do it alone. Community</a><a name="ts_1863780_1869280_" > is for a person to heal. For children, the presence of attuned and responsive caregivers is crucial.</a><a name="ts_1869500_1874480_" > And adults also benefit from healing in the context of relationships. And I think that&#x27;s why</a><a name="ts_1874480_1880020_" > groups like AA or veterans groups or religious communities, and of course your family and friends,</a><a name="ts_1880020_1885560_" > can all provide the physical and emotional safety needed for a person to process their trauma.</a><a name="ts_1885780_1891520_" > Research shows that one of the first things people do when facing a severe threat is to look around for</a><a name="ts_1891520_1896680_" > someone to help them. When we&#x27;re involved in the love of a parent, a spouse, or another protector,</a><a name="ts_1896980_1902920_" > their body can return to a sense of safety. Loving, attuned relationships can even prevent a traumatic</a><a name="ts_1902920_1908940_" > event from becoming trauma for that person. But when it&#x27;s the caregivers who create the trauma,</a><a name="ts_1909420_1913420_" > patients rely on their relationship to their therapist. So they need to know that their therapist</a><a name="ts_1913420_1919040_" > cares about them as a person. One of Vanderkoek&#x27;s teachers taught, the job of a therapist is to help</a><a name="ts_1919040_1924860_" > people acknowledge, experience, and bear the reality of life. I also hope that all of you can develop</a><a name="ts_1924860_1930460_" > strong relationships with a support group, a faith community, friends, and family. But a therapist</a><a name="ts_1930460_1936560_" > just might be the first person in your tribe. Okay, so there&#x27;s a bunch of ways that we can</a><a name="ts_1936560_1941580_" > treat trauma. Okay, now let&#x27;s talk about my big three takeaways from The Body Keeps the Score.</a><a name="ts_1941800_1946780_" > First, it&#x27;s helpful to remember that a mental illness cannot be defined as precisely as most</a><a name="ts_1946780_1952100_" > physical illnesses. Therapists, doctors, teachers, really everyone needs to recognize that a bunch of</a><a name="ts_1952100_1957800_" > behavioral problems probably have trauma at their root. For example, a patient diagnosed with bipolar</a><a name="ts_1957800_1962860_" > disorder because of her mood swings, or depression because of her despair, or ADHD because of her</a><a name="ts_1962860_1967040_" > lack of attention. This person could be medicated to treat the symptoms for all of those things.</a><a name="ts_1967240_1973860_" > But a good therapist is going to look at the whole picture and evaluate whether there&#x27;s an underlying</a><a name="ts_1973860_1978340_" > trauma that needs to be healed. I&#x27;m not saying that all those conditions are caused by trauma. I&#x27;m</a><a name="ts_1978340_1982800_" > saying sometimes the behaviors that look like those conditions are actually rooted in trauma. Okay,</a><a name="ts_1982800_1987560_" > number two. There are a lot of ways to heal trauma, and most survivors need a combination of those</a><a name="ts_1987560_1992580_" > methods. Van der Kolk groups them into six categories. Dealing with hyperarousal. Medication,</a><a name="ts_1992740_1997680_" > yoga, and rhythms help here. Mindfulness, slowing down to bring self-awareness to how the body is doing</a><a name="ts_1997680_2003480_" > when the brain thinks about past trauma will help process the trauma. Relationships, connecting with</a><a name="ts_2003480_2007960_" > others who provide physical and emotional safety to process the trauma. Sensory integration,</a><a name="ts_2007960_2012960_" > like communal rhythms and playing together in groups help restore attunement to others and self.</a><a name="ts_2013100_2018220_" > Physical touch and body work. So methods like therapeutic massage, craniosacral therapy,</a><a name="ts_2018480_2023820_" > these help release emotional tension and help a dissociated person wake up to the parts of the body</a><a name="ts_2023820_2030400_" > being touched. Let the body take action. Survivors who are forced to submit or be still when abused or</a><a name="ts_2030400_2035780_" > attacked need to be able to act on the physical impulses that they couldn&#x27;t take in the middle of trauma.</a><a name="ts_2035780_2041000_" > They need to, in a safe and healthy way, be able to hit, push, or run away.</a><a name="ts_2041140_2047600_" > Which takes me to my third takeaway. There really is so much we can do to heal from trauma. One of my</a><a name="ts_2047600_2052140_" > favorite anecdotes from the book is about a woman whose childhood was filled with abuse. She enrolled</a><a name="ts_2052140_2057060_" > in what&#x27;s called a model mugging program, which teaches women to recondition their freeze response and</a><a name="ts_2057060_2062200_" > turn fear into fighting energy. So shortly after finishing this program, this college student was walking</a><a name="ts_2062200_2066960_" > alone when three male attackers jumped out of some bushes and demanded money. Her new response</a><a name="ts_2066960_2072360_" > was to take a karate stance and yell back at them. Okay, guys, I&#x27;ve been looking forward to this</a><a name="ts_2072360_2077640_" > moment. Who wants to take me on first? And all three attackers ran away. So I love this. It&#x27;s a wonderful</a><a name="ts_2077640_2083500_" > example of how a person can be empowered through their trauma. We can process trauma in such a way that the</a><a name="ts_2083500_2089360_" > brain stays online. We can stay connected to language and story and the body can stay calm all at the same time.</a><a name="ts_2089360_2093640_" > If this video feels overwhelming to you, like maybe you&#x27;re feeling overwhelmed by all of the</a><a name="ts_2093640_2098180_" > impacts of trauma on the brain and body, or maybe you&#x27;re feeling overwhelmed by all the work that</a><a name="ts_2098180_2102960_" > that might need to be done to heal from trauma, I would just say, take a breath. You&#x27;re okay.</a><a name="ts_2103440_2107260_" > Let&#x27;s just do one thing at a time. So if one thing from this video stood out to you,</a><a name="ts_2107580_2110940_" > like write that down and think, how can I do a little research on this topic?</a><a name="ts_2111200_2115040_" > How could I learn about this? Maybe I could watch a video on this, or who could I reach out to on this?</a><a name="ts_2115040_2120060_" > And just work on that one little step, okay? And I really believe if we do tiny steps</a><a name="ts_2120060_2122960_" > one at a time, little by little, we&#x27;ll get a little more energy. We&#x27;ll get a little healthier.</a><a name="ts_2123300_2127980_" > We&#x27;ll get feeling a little more secure in our own bodies. And that&#x27;s going to give us more energy to</a><a name="ts_2127980_2131960_" > take step over too. Okay. I really believe trauma can be can be treated effectively.</a><a name="ts_2132320_2138510_" > Okay. So what did you think of this book? I really liked it. When it was published back in 2014,</a><a name="ts_2138910_2144270_" > Vanna Cooke said that we are on the verge of becoming a trauma conscious society. And I think this book has</a><a name="ts_2144270_2149730_" > contributed to our society talking about what was once taboo and ignored. And I think that&#x27;s a</a><a name="ts_2149730_2154710_" > really good thing. I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend this book to everyone because there are a lot of</a><a name="ts_2154710_2159870_" > triggering stories, but I would recommend it to school teachers and other caregivers, or those who</a><a name="ts_2159870_2165030_" > have friends or loved ones who are dealing with PTSD. You&#x27;ll come away with a good understanding of how</a><a name="ts_2165030_2170730_" > deeply trauma affects the whole person. And if you do know a trauma survivor who could benefit from therapy,</a><a name="ts_2170730_2175410_" > maybe consider sharing this video with them so that they can see that there are a lot of options</a><a name="ts_2175410_2179630_" > for healing trauma. Hopefully at least one of the treatment methods that I mentioned will click for</a><a name="ts_2179630_2183590_" > them. I also have a PDF download with a list of the different therapy methods from the book,</a><a name="ts_2183710_2188450_" > so you could print that off and talk with your therapist about it and other options that are available</a><a name="ts_2188450_2193250_" > for you in your area. Okay. Lastly, if you&#x27;d like to learn how to regulate your nervous system,</a><a name="ts_2193430_2198390_" > I&#x27;ve got a free online course grounding skills for stress, anxiety, and PTSD. You&#x27;ll learn to work</a><a name="ts_2198390_2202190_" > through that fight flight freeze response and return to a state of calm. And again,</a><a name="ts_2202330_2206590_" > the link&#x27;s in the description. Okay. If you&#x27;re living with the effects of trauma, I hope this video</a><a name="ts_2206590_2211230_" > helps you know what your next step toward healing could be, because healing really is possible.</a><a name="ts_2211610_2213088_" > Thank you for watching and take care.</a></p></div></body>
