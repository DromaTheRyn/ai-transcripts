You sit down to do the work, but five minutes into it, you&#x27;re already itching to just scroll again.</a><a name="ts_25680_31400_" > For some reason, you can&#x27;t finish that damn painting you started, or even worse, you haven&#x27;t even started at all.</a><a name="ts_31520_32660_" > You&#x27;ve just been researching.</a><a name="ts_32940_39760_" > If this sounds like you, then you might have a very, very concerningly short attention span.</a><a name="ts_39920_44080_" > You might even think you have ADHD, unless you&#x27;re actually diagnosed with it.</a><a name="ts_44100_53600_" > But if you watch until the end of this video, in full screen, no looking at the comments, no two-time speed, no looking at other tabs, close everything right now, without doing anything else.</a><a name="ts_53600_56360_" > Like, no folding your clothes, no brushing your teeth, just stop everything.</a><a name="ts_56580_60200_" > Just focus on my face, listen to my voice, don&#x27;t fall in love though.</a><a name="ts_60480_66420_" > But if you do this, and watch until the end of the video, you&#x27;ll have improved your focus by at least 1%.</a><a name="ts_66420_67320_" > No BS.</a><a name="ts_67540_71840_" > Now that you&#x27;ve seen the hook of the video, you&#x27;re probably thinking it&#x27;s gonna be easy.</a><a name="ts_72000_73280_" > Then, you&#x27;re mistaken.</a><a name="ts_73280_74400_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_74400_76850_" > You wanna improve your focus and de-stimulate yourself.</a><a name="ts_77430_79450_" > This is how it&#x27;s going to feel like.</a><a name="ts_79450_85150_" > From now on, I&#x27;m not gonna put any subtitles, no b-rolls, no edits, or maybe a few trims here and there.</a><a name="ts_85270_93870_" > But for the rest of this video, completely opposite from what you&#x27;ve seen earlier, I&#x27;m gonna try to make it as simple and de-stimulating as possible.</a><a name="ts_93930_94550_" > So good luck.</a><a name="ts_94750_95750_" > I&#x27;m not gonna BS you.</a><a name="ts_95970_99930_" > This is gonna feel uncomfortable, agonizing, terrible even.</a><a name="ts_100490_102750_" > But I dare you to finish this video.</a><a name="ts_102950_106170_" > So why are people suddenly talking about attention span these days?</a><a name="ts_106170_113370_" > It has become a popular topic, because I found this study that said 20 years ago, people had an attention span of 12 seconds.</a><a name="ts_113850_115150_" > Specifically, the millennials.</a><a name="ts_115630_119130_" > Today, Gen Zs now have 8 seconds of attention span.</a><a name="ts_119470_121710_" > It has decreased to 3 seconds.</a><a name="ts_121950_123530_" > You might already know the reason.</a><a name="ts_123690_131010_" > I have, like, 5-year-old cousins that I live with, who spend 5 hours a day on YouTube shorts.</a><a name="ts_131010_137610_" > And I guarantee you, by the time they&#x27;re, like, 15 or something, they&#x27;re probably gonna have an attention span of 5 seconds.</a><a name="ts_137870_138730_" > I don&#x27;t know.</a><a name="ts_138890_139730_" > It&#x27;s scary.</a><a name="ts_139770_141630_" > It&#x27;s concerning, for sure.</a><a name="ts_141750_146750_" > But that&#x27;s how this whole decrease your attention span and dopamine detox thing is going.</a><a name="ts_146910_147510_" > Here&#x27;s the thing, though.</a><a name="ts_147930_149570_" > This is not our fault.</a><a name="ts_149730_153408_" > We did not ask to be born in this age of...</a><a name="ts_154272_161350_" > We didn&#x27;t ask to be born in this age of technology and social media and unlimited, endless content and information.</a><a name="ts_161350_171630_" > Assuming you&#x27;re also a Gen Z, then we knew that we grew up with literal content machines that are built to keep us scrolling and scrolling and scrolling.</a><a name="ts_171930_175990_" > So just to put it out there, don&#x27;t worry, this isn&#x27;t entirely your fault.</a><a name="ts_176150_181250_" > So you can stop thinking that you have ADHD, again, unless you are actually diagnosed with it.</a><a name="ts_181410_186330_" > But it is, whether we like it or not, our responsibility to fix this.</a><a name="ts_186330_192390_" > So right now, our baseline is probably, like, our baseline for being entertained or being stimulated.</a><a name="ts_192930_196544_" > Our baseline is probably, like, all the way up there.</a><a name="ts_197312_198150_" > It&#x27;s a stairway of heaven.</a><a name="ts_198310_199790_" > It&#x27;s at an all-time high.</a><a name="ts_200030_204130_" > Again, because of the short-form content or just the algorithm itself.</a><a name="ts_204130_205130_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_205130_212550_" > Notifications, the Spotify playlist you play while you&#x27;re brushing your teeth or literally just showering.</a><a name="ts_212550_217430_" > And the obvious, unsexy answer is to just do the complete opposite.</a><a name="ts_217430_227610_" > To be able to pull down that baseline and actually be able to focus because you&#x27;re not going to be needing to constantly depend on quick hits of dopamine throughout your day.</a><a name="ts_227690_229550_" > Let&#x27;s just do the complete opposite.</a><a name="ts_229730_233510_" > Instead of being stimulated, just so obvious, just be bored.</a><a name="ts_234110_236590_" > Just learn to embrace boredom.</a><a name="ts_236590_245870_" > Back then, and I mean, like, one year ago, I literally could not stand a minute without checking my phone or at least just having my phone in my hand.</a><a name="ts_246030_248650_" > I could not stand longer periods of time without that.</a><a name="ts_248770_258690_" > But nowadays, I&#x27;ve trained my attention span so good to the point that I can confidently and comfortably leave my headphones at home when I go outside.</a><a name="ts_258690_264410_" > Or I can even just go for a walk for, like, 15 minutes without my phone.</a><a name="ts_264410_269310_" > And I achieved this, I believe, or I remember, from doing these two simple things.</a><a name="ts_269670_271130_" > One, throw my phone in the ocean.</a><a name="ts_271290_271730_" > Just kidding.</a><a name="ts_272090_273070_" > Make my phone boring.</a><a name="ts_273310_276970_" > And two, do boring shit or build boring habits.</a><a name="ts_277270_278510_" > Or, like, just those two.</a><a name="ts_278590_279130_" > They&#x27;re the same thing.</a><a name="ts_279290_281310_" > So we&#x27;re taking this all back to the basics.</a><a name="ts_282190_287670_" > I assume you know this already, but if you don&#x27;t, here are the basic of the most basic steps to take right now.</a><a name="ts_288170_289650_" > One, turn off your notifications.</a><a name="ts_290090_291570_" > Literally, just go to your settings.</a><a name="ts_291570_295230_" > Turn off every single notification for every single app that you have.</a><a name="ts_295430_301950_" > If you&#x27;re worried that you&#x27;re gonna get an emergency or you&#x27;re not gonna get called, sure, you can, like, keep the notifications on for messages.</a><a name="ts_302270_307210_" > You know, like, the basic message app or your phone app where people can call you and stuff.</a><a name="ts_307450_313890_" > Usually, that would still, in, like, my phone, that would still be, I would still be notified for things like that.</a><a name="ts_313890_317890_" > But it&#x27;s very rarely because very rarely will I have emergencies.</a><a name="ts_318410_327530_" > Second one, I don&#x27;t see most people talk about this, but I guess instead of deleting your social media apps, you can download a minimalist launcher app.</a><a name="ts_327770_330630_" > So, for example, for Android, I use Olauncher app.</a><a name="ts_330730_332810_" > I&#x27;m just gonna link it in the description.</a><a name="ts_333150_338610_" > For iPhone, I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s this one thing called, one app called Minimalist Phone.</a><a name="ts_338610_342250_" > Yeah, there&#x27;s a lot in Play Store or App Store.</a><a name="ts_342590_343790_" > Just start using that, honestly.</a><a name="ts_343970_348750_" > It&#x27;s, like, have changed my entire life when I started using Minimalist Launcher.</a><a name="ts_348910_352750_" > So, basically, what it does is hide icons from your phone.</a><a name="ts_353070_355510_" > Like, the app icons itself.</a><a name="ts_355510_360940_" > So, my phone right now is just, when I open it, this is the only thing it shows.</a><a name="ts_360940_362944_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_362944_364210_" > That&#x27;s, that&#x27;s my home screen.</a><a name="ts_364670_365410_" > That&#x27;s, that&#x27;s it.</a><a name="ts_365470_366090_" > That&#x27;s my home screen.</a><a name="ts_366230_367670_" > These emojis are, like, the apps.</a><a name="ts_367770_371010_" > So, that&#x27;s, like, the calendar, Google, Notes app.</a><a name="ts_371190_375230_" > And then, to find, like, the other apps, I just, there they are.</a><a name="ts_375530_376410_" > I don&#x27;t know if you can see.</a><a name="ts_376410_377952_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_377952_378860_" > They&#x27;re just words.</a><a name="ts_379100_381860_" > The apps, the app icons are basically just words.</a><a name="ts_382120_386260_" > But, yeah, this just makes it so that your phone just looks more unattractive.</a><a name="ts_386260_390970_" > Also, another thing, I guess, is to, like, get a boring phone case as well.</a><a name="ts_390970_392030_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_392030_395310_" > Take off, like, the, you know, like, the labubus that they put on top?</a><a name="ts_395430_396450_" > I never had one of those.</a><a name="ts_397150_397770_" > Take it off.</a><a name="ts_397930_402670_" > Also, like, the, a strap, lace, something that you attach on, like, the side.</a><a name="ts_402890_407930_" > So, that, all those stuff just makes your phone look more appealing to yourself.</a><a name="ts_408110_409410_" > You&#x27;re just putting yourself in a trap.</a><a name="ts_409510_412190_" > When your phone looks nice, you just pick it up every single time.</a><a name="ts_412370_413650_" > Just because you want to pick it up.</a><a name="ts_413770_416630_" > So, yeah, make it physically look unattractive.</a><a name="ts_416770_421110_" > And the third one, this doesn&#x27;t actually make your phone physically boring.</a><a name="ts_421250_424330_" > But, it&#x27;s something I used to do and still do now.</a><a name="ts_424610_430270_" > Because it just reduces my screen time and my tendency to pick up my phone the most.</a><a name="ts_430410_435470_" > Every night before you go to sleep, take your phone, go outside, go out your room.</a><a name="ts_435930_439190_" > Find a room in your house that&#x27;s far away from your bedroom.</a><a name="ts_439370_440790_" > And hide your phone there.</a><a name="ts_441290_443210_" > Just hide your phone anywhere in that room.</a><a name="ts_443210_447370_" > Just make sure your phone is not gonna be near you in the morning when you wake up.</a><a name="ts_447470_456790_" > Because when you wake up, I want you to try not to check your phone for at least, minimum, at least one hour after waking up.</a><a name="ts_456950_461090_" > This automatically reduces your screen time or, again, your tendency to scroll.</a><a name="ts_461210_464570_" > Because you&#x27;re not gonna start with your day with immediately scrolling.</a><a name="ts_464570_466350_" > Okay, so, how are you feeling right now?</a><a name="ts_466450_468270_" > I hope you&#x27;re not dying.</a><a name="ts_468430_469590_" > Someone&#x27;s knocking on the door.</a><a name="ts_469810_470170_" > Oh my god.</a><a name="ts_470170_471290_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_471290_472590_" > So, have you done the basic things?</a><a name="ts_473030_474130_" > If you have, congrats.</a><a name="ts_474250_475810_" > You&#x27;ve gotten rid of the main distraction.</a><a name="ts_476210_479090_" > You&#x27;ve gained hours of your time back just in a day.</a><a name="ts_479290_481390_" > Now, what the heck do you actually spend it with?</a><a name="ts_481650_487810_" > Now, obviously, the first thing is the studies or the hobbies that you wanted to focus on in the first place.</a><a name="ts_487810_495530_" > You can do this first thing in the morning, literally, to replace the time that you spend with scrolling first thing when you wake up.</a><a name="ts_495630_503780_" > Plus, if it&#x27;s gonna be your priority or whatever your priority is, then it&#x27;s best to do it first thing in the morning.</a><a name="ts_503980_506240_" > Just cause it&#x27;s a priority, right?</a><a name="ts_506440_509980_" > Aside from this, you can also build boring habits.</a><a name="ts_510200_514440_" > Well, maybe boring to you right now because of, again, your baseline.</a><a name="ts_514440_518640_" > But habits that actually become fun after a few weeks of doing it.</a><a name="ts_518840_523390_" > It might not sound possible to you right now, but trust me, just be consistent with it.</a><a name="ts_523450_525190_" > This might be stuff like exercising.</a><a name="ts_525510_529710_" > Different types of exercising, maybe like running, any sports, calisthenics.</a><a name="ts_529950_531350_" > It could also be meditating.</a><a name="ts_532250_537190_" > That&#x27;s something I also did back then, but I&#x27;m gonna be honest, right now I&#x27;m not doing it as much.</a><a name="ts_537350_539570_" > There&#x27;s also journaling, my personal favorite.</a><a name="ts_539770_542830_" > It&#x27;s something that I did the most back then.</a><a name="ts_542830_547230_" > I was able to spend hours just writing and writing, whatever thought comes to mind.</a><a name="ts_547490_560810_" > And if you really just can&#x27;t not consume right now, then I guess you could either read books or watch long form, almost unedited content like this.</a><a name="ts_561070_567430_" > Obviously, it has to be something of your interest so you actually like what you&#x27;re watching and you&#x27;re learning from it.</a><a name="ts_567430_571430_" > And here&#x27;s the catch, I want you to watch it from start to finish.</a><a name="ts_571790_577890_" > Again, with no other distraction and just focus on the thing that you&#x27;re watching.</a><a name="ts_578090_581010_" > And I don&#x27;t care how boring or uninteresting it gets.</a><a name="ts_581150_585770_" > You should at least try to finish watching it till the end.</a><a name="ts_585770_592650_" > It also helps you so that you&#x27;re not constantly clicking away and finding other content to consume.</a><a name="ts_592770_600250_" > And it makes it so that you get used to being uncomfortable, which is, again, the complete opposite of always being entertained, stimulated.</a><a name="ts_600410_607590_" > And finally, another, I guess, unpopular habit that I tried was to, when I had nothing else to do, I just did nothing.</a><a name="ts_607830_610990_" > Literally just stare off into the distance or zone out.</a><a name="ts_610990_617110_" > For example, when you&#x27;re waiting in line or, like, commuting or walking to school, resist.</a><a name="ts_617370_620090_" > I just resisted trying to reach for my phone.</a><a name="ts_620230_625470_" > What you do instead is entertain yourself with what&#x27;s already in your surroundings.</a><a name="ts_625470_628050_" > You can literally just observe everything.</a><a name="ts_628250_637090_" > From the people having conversations, don&#x27;t be a weirdo though, to the buildings passing by or, heck, even an ant on the floor.</a><a name="ts_637090_644550_" > The point is to just try to be present in the moment and, again, embrace the boredom.</a><a name="ts_644750_647190_" > Because if you didn&#x27;t know, you&#x27;re allowed to feel bored.</a><a name="ts_647330_650630_" > You&#x27;re allowed to not do anything.</a><a name="ts_650810_654750_" > And most especially, allow your thoughts to come into the surface.</a><a name="ts_654750_664050_" > Because I know most of the time, you&#x27;re trying to not be bored or trying to not, not do anything because you&#x27;re trying to avoid thoughts.</a><a name="ts_664430_668630_" > You&#x27;re trying to avoid your own thoughts and the reality of everything.</a><a name="ts_668810_672030_" > Maybe stress, something, something just unpleasant.</a><a name="ts_672350_679610_" > Facing your thoughts is uncomfortable, which is exactly the habit that we should try to get used to if you want to enhance your focus and your attention.</a><a name="ts_679610_685370_" > Because after a while of doing this, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s really not that bad.</a><a name="ts_685630_694910_" > And, again, this worked for me because that was basically rewiring my brain to not have to depend on quick hits of dopamine throughout the day.</a><a name="ts_695010_700070_" > Where I can just sit with my thoughts, watch people pass by, look at the sky, and think.</a><a name="ts_700350_702770_" > So, it&#x27;s basically like the way of the monks.</a><a name="ts_702990_704070_" > So, congrats!</a><a name="ts_704330_705970_" > You&#x27;ve made it to the end of the video.</a><a name="ts_706410_706710_" > Woo!</a><a name="ts_706710_709930_" > You&#x27;ve got a taste of what it feels like to be bored.</a><a name="ts_710090_713090_" > Probably bored of my voice and bored of my face.</a><a name="ts_713210_721290_" > If you actually watch to the end without any distractions, I know it feels uncomfortable, agonizing, terrible.</a><a name="ts_721550_723510_" > That&#x27;s what dopamine detox basically is.</a><a name="ts_723690_725930_" > You gotta use willpower for the most part.</a><a name="ts_726070_730410_" > It&#x27;s not fun, but I guarantee you will get more things done.</a><a name="ts_730410_739770_" > Once you stop depending on these quick hits of dopamine, then you will actually feel almost free and liberated.</a><a name="ts_740150_745440_" > It will be hard in the start, but like any other thing, it will be worth it in the end.</a><a name="ts_745600_748820_" > You will literally be fine without your phone anymore.</a><a name="ts_748940_755080_" > Which you probably think is a crazy thing to say right now, but trust me, you can stop being a slave to your phone.</a><a name="ts_755080_759560_" > Because
