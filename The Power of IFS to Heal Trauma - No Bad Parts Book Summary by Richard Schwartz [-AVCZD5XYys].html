Family therapy!</a><a name="ts_133530_135770_" > And in family therapy, you&#x27;re trained to work</a><a name="ts_135770_138510_" > with a bunch of family members all in the same room</a><a name="ts_138510_139610_" > and to look for their dynamics.</a><a name="ts_139910_143070_" > There might be a problem child and a critical parent</a><a name="ts_143070_145130_" > and a rescuer parent, for example.</a><a name="ts_145470_147810_" > Each of them plays a role in the family system.</a><a name="ts_147850_149610_" > And the more you pressure them,</a><a name="ts_149750_151610_" > the more rigid they become in those roles.</a><a name="ts_151750_153910_" > So for example, if the father is the critical parent,</a><a name="ts_154130_157470_" > the more he criticizes the problem child,</a><a name="ts_157670_160590_" > the more likely she is to act out.</a><a name="ts_160590_163010_" > And the more critical the father is,</a><a name="ts_163170_166190_" > the more likely the mother steps in to rescue the child.</a><a name="ts_166630_168110_" > Now Dick started to see this dynamic</a><a name="ts_168110_169910_" > when he was working with bulimic patients.</a><a name="ts_170290_173350_" > And he tried to work with the families of bulimic patients.</a><a name="ts_173490_175630_" > But when he found that that wasn&#x27;t working,</a><a name="ts_175650_176450_" > he got curious.</a><a name="ts_176770_177530_" > Here&#x27;s what he said.</a><a name="ts_177710_180230_" > They kept binging and purging, much to my frustration.</a><a name="ts_180230_181610_" > And I began asking why.</a><a name="ts_181730_184450_" > And they started talking this language of parts.</a><a name="ts_185050_187750_" > And I&#x27;d say some version of when something bad happens,</a><a name="ts_187790_190430_" > this critic attacks me inside and it brings up a part</a><a name="ts_190590_193030_" > that makes me feel worthless and empty and alone.</a><a name="ts_193310_197630_" > And that feeling is so dreadful that the binge comes in to rescue me from it.</a><a name="ts_197730_199710_" > But the act of the binge triggers the critic again.</a><a name="ts_199850_202230_" > And it sounded as a family therapist familiar,</a><a name="ts_202470_205030_" > because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve been studying, these patterns and families.</a><a name="ts_205210_209730_" > At first, I thought, well, it&#x27;s a nice metaphor for different emotions and thoughts.</a><a name="ts_209730_211330_" > And we can work with that.</a><a name="ts_211490_216910_" > But they were talking about these things as if they had full personalities and a lot of autonomy.</a><a name="ts_217130_218470_" > And that they couldn&#x27;t control them.</a><a name="ts_218650_219430_" > Then I got scared.</a><a name="ts_219570_222950_" > I thought, maybe these are people with multiple personality disorder.</a><a name="ts_223190_225870_" > Until I started listening inside myself and, oh my god, I&#x27;ve got them too.</a><a name="ts_226090_230430_" > And mine are as full personalities and sometimes as extreme as theirs.</a><a name="ts_230430_238560_" > And then I just got curious and have spent the next 40 years studying these internal systems.</a><a name="ts_238560_240920_" > In No Bad Parts, he writes,</a><a name="ts_241460_243020_" > When we simply turn our attention inside,</a><a name="ts_243300_246900_" > we find that what we thought were random thoughts and emotions</a><a name="ts_246900_252260_" > comprise a bustling inner community that has been interacting behind the scenes throughout our lives.</a><a name="ts_252580_256440_" > Now, to be clear, IFS is different from dissociative identity disorder.</a><a name="ts_256780_260140_" > In fact, having parts is normal, it&#x27;s natural, and it&#x27;s healthy.</a><a name="ts_260640_263160_" > IFS says we&#x27;re all born with these parts.</a><a name="ts_263160_267120_" > And the goal is learning how to work with them with clarity and compassion.</a><a name="ts_267520_271410_" > Now, unlike the movie Inside Out, these parts aren&#x27;t just emotions.</a><a name="ts_271610_277330_" > They can be like little people that you visualize with their own thoughts and feelings and needs.</a><a name="ts_277650_283296_" > They often have important roles like keeping you safe or numbing you to pain or motivating you to try hard.</a><a name="ts_283936_290150_" > Sometimes these parts are just a bodily sensation that you have or a quiet little voice.</a><a name="ts_290550_292650_" > And often there are parts we aren&#x27;t even aware of.</a><a name="ts_292650_296250_" > There&#x27;s also parts that are really loud that take most of our attention.</a><a name="ts_296750_302750_" > Now, in IFS, these different parts are categorized as either protectors or exiles.</a><a name="ts_303010_306470_" > So exiles are the wounded parts, right?</a><a name="ts_306530_312430_" > These are the parts of us that carry the most pain or shame or fear or feelings of worthlessness.</a><a name="ts_312630_313810_" > They&#x27;re often younger.</a><a name="ts_313810_318110_" > They&#x27;re vulnerable parts that got exiled or pushed away from awareness</a><a name="ts_318110_323650_" > because those emotions felt too overwhelming or because the other parts decided it wasn&#x27;t safe</a><a name="ts_323650_325530_" > to let them show up in daily life.</a><a name="ts_325890_333504_" > Some common exiles are the invisible child who was neglected or the rejected teenager who was bullied.</a><a name="ts_334208_333504_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_334490_338650_" > And then there are protectors who are just trying to keep us safe.</a><a name="ts_338670_341010_" > And there are two types of protectors.</a><a name="ts_341110_343670_" > There&#x27;s managers and firefighters.</a><a name="ts_343670_348270_" > Now, managers are the planners and the controllers who are trying to prevent pain.</a><a name="ts_348430_350030_" > They are proactive.</a><a name="ts_350310_352790_" > They can look like perfectionism, humor, worry.</a><a name="ts_352950_355390_" > They can look like planning or controlling behaviors.</a><a name="ts_355610_361030_" > They can show up as like overachieving, people pleasing or avoiding risks or rejection.</a><a name="ts_361290_366690_" > They&#x27;re usually very tired and stressed out because they&#x27;re working all the time.</a><a name="ts_367050_368512_" > Some of them never sleep.</a><a name="ts_369184_369390_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_369810_371850_" > Firefighters are there for crises.</a><a name="ts_371850_373550_" > They are reactive.</a><a name="ts_373950_379390_" > Their role is to rush in when the exiles get triggered and to extinguish that overwhelming pain.</a><a name="ts_379570_383950_" > These can look like rage, self-harm, dissociation, substance use.</a><a name="ts_384130_390330_" > They might show up as angrily defending yourself against criticism or numbing yourself with alcohol</a><a name="ts_390330_391840_" > to avoid disappointment.</a><a name="ts_392544_395670_" > So managers and firefighters are usually fighting, right?</a><a name="ts_395810_399430_" > They, this one wants you to be more self-controlled and this one wants you to not</a><a name="ts_399430_400350_" > feel so much.</a><a name="ts_401280_402450_" > Now, why won&#x27;t they back down?</a><a name="ts_402510_404170_" > Why won&#x27;t they stop fighting with each other?</a><a name="ts_404570_406010_" > It&#x27;s because they love you.</a><a name="ts_406190_407550_" > They love you too much to do that.</a><a name="ts_407690_411230_" > They&#x27;re convinced that they are helping you and that&#x27;s why they won&#x27;t give up.</a><a name="ts_411350_414710_" > It&#x27;s not because they&#x27;re stubborn or mean or bad.</a><a name="ts_414870_417810_" > So the important thing to remember is there are no bad parts.</a><a name="ts_418070_423390_" > Every part has a good intention behind what it&#x27;s doing, right?</a><a name="ts_423570_427110_" > A part that yells at your partner really cares about the relationship</a><a name="ts_427630_430070_" > and whether or not your spouse shows up for you.</a><a name="ts_430330_433930_" > A part that criticizes you wants you to get better and improve.</a><a name="ts_434230_438016_" > A part that uses substances wants you to feel better and have fun.</a><a name="ts_438816_443970_" > When a member of our family is trying to fight us or it seems to be undermining us,</a><a name="ts_444090_449550_" > it&#x27;s natural to want to change them or to argue with them or to avoid them.</a><a name="ts_450010_455150_" > But what we find with IFS is that fighting our parts usually leads to more dysfunction.</a><a name="ts_455710_459930_" > Trying to suppress those inner voices leads to more internal struggle.</a><a name="ts_460170_463730_" > Or it just it allows these protectors to run our life.</a><a name="ts_463950_468050_" > So, for example, like trying to hate your perfectionistic part</a><a name="ts_468050_472010_" > can lead to more self-hatred and fuel more perfectionism.</a><a name="ts_472010_473088_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_473088_475010_" > IFS sees all of our parts,</a><a name="ts_475010_476790_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_476790_481110_" > exiles, managers, and firefighters not as something bad that we need to get rid of,</a><a name="ts_481370_483250_" > but as hurt parts that need care.</a><a name="ts_483670_488090_" > These are often innocent young children who took on the responsibility of life</a><a name="ts_488090_491104_" > and they shouldn&#x27;t have to carry that load anymore.</a><a name="ts_491680_493170_" > So, like, how do we do it, right?</a><a name="ts_493190_496830_" > I&#x27;m talking in theory now, but let&#x27;s move a little bit toward practice.</a><a name="ts_497110_500670_" > In IFS therapy, the goal is not to keep suppressing these parts,</a><a name="ts_500670_506690_" > but to build enough safety and self-leadership that these exiles and protectors can finally</a><a name="ts_506690_509450_" > be witnessed, comforted, and unburdened.</a><a name="ts_509650_512650_" > Each one of these needs reassurance that you can be kept safe</a><a name="ts_512650_516470_" > and needs to be able to trust that you can handle life as it comes at you.</a><a name="ts_516590_520350_" > And then when that happens, all of these parts can transform.</a><a name="ts_520350_524570_" > They can they can shift roles and their roles now become ones</a><a name="ts_524570_527490_" > where they&#x27;re like vital and creative and connected.</a><a name="ts_527490_532110_" > like all that energy they were putting into fighting each other turns into like helping</a><a name="ts_532110_533270_" > you become your best person.</a><a name="ts_533630_537030_" > So instead of trying to kill the parts of ourselves that we don&#x27;t like,</a><a name="ts_537450_541790_" > IFS teaches us to listen to them and create a healthy internal family.</a><a name="ts_542230_545710_" > So an amazing thing happens when you start to notice your parts,</a><a name="ts_545990_549070_" > when you start to see them and name them and listen to them.</a><a name="ts_549370_552710_" > There&#x27;s this incredible part of you that starts to emerge.</a><a name="ts_553030_556704_" > And in IFS, it&#x27;s called the self with a capital S.</a><a name="ts_557632_560130_" > Now, the self is the deepest part of you.</a><a name="ts_560390_566130_" > It holds all of the parts, kind of like how an ocean holds all of its fishes.</a><a name="ts_566670_571810_" > The self is who leads, guides, listens to, and comforts each of the parts.</a><a name="ts_571950_575530_" > And you guys like this is my favorite part of IFS,</a><a name="ts_575670_579960_" > because like when you can let the self do its work,</a><a name="ts_580280_584640_" > both your internal and external relationships just have more peace.</a><a name="ts_585344_587250_" > Okay, let me share a personal example.</a><a name="ts_587410_590030_" > The other day, my husband and I were trying to have a planning session.</a><a name="ts_590410_592290_" > Now, planning makes him anxious.</a><a name="ts_592710_595010_" > And when I have no plan, I feel anxious.</a><a name="ts_595130_597230_" > Okay, so this is a difficult situation.</a><a name="ts_597650_601550_" > So we&#x27;re sitting down talking about our calendar, and I remind him for the second</a><a name="ts_601550_605410_" > or third time about a task that needs to be done that he agreed to do.</a><a name="ts_605890_610630_" > And he asks me to explain it to him again for the third time.</a><a name="ts_611110_613350_" > Now, I start to feel somewhat angry and annoyed.</a><a name="ts_613350_615170_" > Like, oh, why do I have to plan everything?</a><a name="ts_615330_616190_" > Does he even care?</a><a name="ts_616410_617590_" > This is so frustrating.</a><a name="ts_617830_620370_" > And then I started to feel bad for getting angry.</a><a name="ts_620370_622810_" > So then I just stopped talking.</a><a name="ts_623110_626650_" > Now, he paused for a minute, and I took a breath and closed my eyes.</a><a name="ts_627530_631424_" > And I could see this, like, angry part of me.</a><a name="ts_631424_632608_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_632608_637050_" > It was this part of me that feels hurt and unloved when people don&#x27;t pay attention to me.</a><a name="ts_637270_639104_" > And this is a firefighter.</a><a name="ts_639776_644600_" > And then because I felt like the victim, because it seems like people don&#x27;t care about me,</a><a name="ts_645040_647880_" > then I could see the manager part jumping in and saying like,</a><a name="ts_647880_652340_" > Oh, don&#x27;t do anything stupid, Emma. Don&#x27;t say anything. Don&#x27;t make Ryan hate planning even</a><a name="ts_652340_655400_" > more because you&#x27;re going to be so sensitive about stuff like this.</a><a name="ts_655660_658240_" > Now, I had just finished reading No Bad Parts.</a><a name="ts_658300_664400_" > So as I noticed these parts coming forward, suddenly I could kind of see them clearly.</a><a name="ts_664660_672760_" > And I felt my capital S self just stepping back and being curious about them.</a><a name="ts_672920_675540_" > I was able to ask them, like, what they needed.</a><a name="ts_675540_679680_" > I felt more centered and I felt myself soften up a little bit.</a><a name="ts_680040_682920_" > So I asked, like, the ragey victim-y part.</a><a name="ts_683160_684720_" > I said, what do you need?</a><a

the manager what she needed.</a><a name="ts_694330_695424_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_695424_700540_" > I need the angry one to not speak up, because if she tells Ryan what she really needs,</a><a name="ts_700700_702048_" > that will push him away.</a><a name="ts_702944_705750_" > And, like, to be honest, if I had told Ryan, like,</a><a name="ts_705750_708290_" > oh, why don&#x27;t you ever pay attention to my planning?</a><a name="ts_708610_710880_" > It would have come out in, like, an angry, judgmental way.</a><a name="ts_711648_717480_" > So then I imagined myself, my capital S self, telling the little angry victim,</a><a name="ts_718240_720690_" > okay, I&#x27;m going to stand up for you.</a><a name="ts_720710_723296_" > I&#x27;m going to stand up for what you need.</a><a name="ts_724160_726360_" > And then I imagined myself telling the manager, don&#x27;t worry.</a><a name="ts_726360_727872_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_727872_730368_" > I&#x27;m going to do it in a calm, firm way.</a><a name="ts_730368_731392_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_731392_734570_" > And my parts reacted by calming down a little bit.</a><a name="ts_734810_736750_" > And I was able to feel more clear.</a><a name="ts_737310_738990_" > Okay, so then I opened my eyes.</a><a name="ts_739930_744250_" > Ryan, the angel that he is, had been patiently sitting there while I had this</a><a name="ts_744250_746130_" > little internal family conversation.</a><a name="ts_746430_751330_" > And I said to him, like, it really helps me feel like you care about me</a><a name="ts_751870_754350_"

he said something along the lines of, like, sure, honey, I&#x27;m sorry I forgot.</a><a name="ts_760990_762144_" > I&#x27;ll do better next time.</a><a name="ts_762144_763970_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_763970_766110_" > And this big problem was solved.</a><a name="ts_766110_771270_" > The self is the gentle and wise leader who can guide your internal family</a><a name="ts_771270_773310_" > to being harmonious and loving.</a><a name="ts_773310_774336_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_774336_779330_" > You don&#x27;t need to be calmer, more curious, or more courageous.</a><a name="ts_779650_782890_" > There&#x27;s a part of you that already is calm.</a><a name="ts_783090_785490_" > It is curious and it is courageous.</a><a name="ts_785490_786530_" > It&#x27;s already there.</a><a name="ts_786710_787910_" > It&#x27;s not damaged.</a><a name="ts_787950_788850_" > It&#x27;s not scared.</a><a name="ts_788870_789830_" > It&#x27;s not wounded.</a><a name="ts_790390_793090_" > And the best way I can describe this is just to tell you, like,</a><a name="ts_793090_795290_" > this is something you have to experience.</a><a name="ts_795850_799880_" > Like, the way you do it is through exercises.</a><a name="ts_800280_802660_" > And these are kind of like little meditations.</a><a name="ts_803140_805780_" > And I&#x27;m really excited for you to learn these with me.</a><a name="ts_805900_814300_" > So in the book, No Bad Parts, the first exercise already has shifted how I interact with myself.</a><a name="ts_814580_818980_" > Like this, I did not expect this from this book, but the first exercise changed me.</a><a name="ts_819220_820832_" > Um, it&#x27;s called Mapping Your Parts.</a><a name="ts_821664_827110_" > It&#x27;s about taking time to get to know our parts and how this can be a really powerful way to reduce</a><a name="ts_827110_832170_" > our internal conflict and free ourself from burdens and pain.</a><a name="ts_832730_838304_" > And the way you do it is you sit down and you quietly pay attention to your body.</a><a name="ts_838304_839552_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_839552_843424_" > And then you just notice the parts of yourself that come up.</a><a name="ts_844416_848610_" > Now, I&#x27;m making a much more detailed version of this exercise as a separate YouTube video.</a><a name="ts_848610_854730_" > So if you really want to experience this, which I think you should, please check out the other video.</a><a name="ts_854890_855870_" > I&#x27;ll put the link in the description.</a><a name="ts_856130_860450_" > Um, and, and you can hear more of me talking to myself.</a><a name="ts_860450_861530_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_861530_863670_" > I guess I demonstrate it as well, okay?</a><a name="ts_863850_865150_" > So that&#x27;s the first exercise.</a><a name="ts_865370_866470_" > It&#x27;s mapping your parts.</a><a name="ts_866770_869050_" > So then after we&#x27;ve mapped our parts, now what?</a><a name="ts_869150_872190_" > Like now we&#x27;ve gotten to know each of these people, but they seem to be fighting a lot.</a><a name="ts_872230_873810_" > Or this one doesn&#x27;t have a voice, right?</a><a name="ts_874270_875650_" > What&#x27;s the next thing we do?</a><a name="ts_875850_877310_" > That&#x27;s what takes us to unblending.</a><a name="ts_877310_879830_" > This is a really essential aspect of IFS.</a><a name="ts_879910_882770_" > And it&#x27;s this idea of blending and unblending.</a><a name="ts_883712_888020_" > So in internal family systems, blending happens when you become fused with a part.</a><a name="ts_888020_890320_" > You feel like the part is you.</a><a name="ts_890520_891900_" > So let me give you some examples.</a><a name="ts_892040_896280_" > You feel overwhelming shame and you think like, I&#x27;m worthless.</a><a name="ts_896560_898260_" > No one could ever love me.</a><a name="ts_898740_901920_" > The exile&#x27;s belief becomes the whole truth.</a><a name="ts_902100_904120_" > That&#x27;s when you&#x27;re blended with an exile.</a><a name="ts_904520_906860_" > You might notice this when you can&#x27;t make a decision</a><a name="ts_906860_909720_" > because your internal family members are arguing.</a><a name="ts_910020_914280_" > Or you keep engaging in unhealthy habits like running away or binging because firefighters</a><a name="ts_914280_916720_" > are desperately trying to control your feelings.</a><a name="ts_916720_917856_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_917856_921700_" > Or you believe you just have to try harder to be better.</a><a name="ts_921940_923280_" > That&#x27;s when you&#x27;re blended with a manager.</a><a name="ts_923740_930290_" > Um, this is the protector part trying to keep you safe by resisting change.</a><a name="ts_930430_932550_" > So when one of our parts is running the show,</a><a name="ts_932550_935530_" > we often get stuck in these unhealthy or reactive behaviors.</a><a name="ts_935770_939130_" > So when I was angry at my husband, my little victim was telling me stories like,</a><a name="ts_939190_940150_" > this is so unfair.</a><a name="ts_940350_942130_" > Why do I have to do everything?</a><a name="ts_942230_943850_" > He never cares about me.</a><a name="ts_943990_947090_" > And it was fueling this angry desire to lash out and criticize him.</a><a name="ts_947210_951680_" > So in that moment, I was blended with my firefighter, my angry little firefighter.</a><a name="ts_952224_958030_" > But when I stepped back and I noticed this part and I used my perspective as myself,</a><a name="ts_958590_960160_" > I could create some space.</a><a name="ts_960736_963488_" > Now, the manager wanted to suppress the victim part,</a><a name="ts_964032_967712_" > but the self was a thoughtful and curious place I could step into.</a><a name="ts_968672_971470_" > Now, I&#x27;ve used ACT for years, acceptance and commitment therapy for years,</a><a name="ts_971610_974770_" > to do what they call defusion, which is where you create some space</a><a name="ts_974770_976430_" > between yourself and your thoughts.</a><a name="ts_976650_983230_" > I have to be honest, like, I found the IFS approach to be so much easier to practice</a><a name="ts_983230_985550_" > than what I&#x27;ve been doing for like 15 years.</a><a name="ts_985790_988550_" > Like, this metaphor just makes it so much easier to apply.</a><a name="ts_988550_991550_" > Now, here&#x27;s how Dick Schwartz describes this in his book.</a><a name="ts_991710_994530_" > When you simply focus on one of the parts,</a><a name="ts_994730_1000352_" > suddenly there was a you who was observing and an it that was being observed.</a><a name="ts_1000960_1002120_" > And this takes us to unblending.</a><a name="ts_1002260_1006440_" > Unblending happens when you notice, oh, like, this is just a part of me.</a><a name="ts_1006560_1010700_" > And then you shift back into that self energy, that calm, curious, compassionate awareness.</a><a name="ts_1011220_1013480_" > Okay, let me walk you through how unblending works.</a><a name="ts_1013600_1016800_" > So instead of believing like, oh, I am worthless,</a><a name="ts_1016800_1023072_" > you would say, oh, I notice that a part of me feels worthless right now.</a><a name="ts_1023616_1027180_" > When your inner critic says, you&#x27;re failing, you pause and think, oh,</a><a name="ts_1027720_1029320_" > that&#x27;s my manager part speaking.</a><a name="ts_1029360_1032320_" > I can listen to it without letting it take over.</a><a name="ts_1032992_1036720_" > Or let&#x27;s say you feel the urge to like binge or numb out.</a><a name="ts_1036940_1039640_" > But instead of acting, you say, oh, that&#x27;s my firefighter part.</a><a name="ts_1039780_1041220_" > It&#x27;s trying to protect me from something.</a><a name="ts_1041220_1046660_" > I can check in with it and see if another behavior would be like more helpful instead.</a><a name="ts_1046660_1047744_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1047744_1050890_" > You can hold compassion for each of these parts when you&#x27;re unblended, right?</a><a name="ts_1050970_1054750_" > So you see, you can say, I see this little sad part of me and it feels so alone.</a><a name="ts_1055030_1056352_" > And I want to be with it.</a><a name="ts_1057152_1059790_" > Or when I was planning with my husband, I could have said, you&#x27;re so unreliable.</a><a name="ts_1059990_1062110_" > But that probably would have invited a lot more fighting.</a><a name="ts_1062650_1066490_" > But if I&#x27;d said like, oh, a part of me feels hurt by you,</a><a name="ts_1066690_1068290_" > that would have been more helpful.</a><a name="ts_1068290_1071970_" > This is one of the most powerful and most simple things you can do.</a><a name="ts_1072190_1075030_" > When you start to notice your parts, you create the space</a><a name="ts_1075030_1078170_" > to act with more calm and compassion.</a><a name="ts_1079104_1081150_" > And then the healing continues to deepen.</a><a name="ts_1081150_1084830_" > So the self goes into each part and helps each part unburden.</a><a name="ts_1084990_1089010_" > And I would say this process is best learned with a therapist trained in IFS.</a><a name="ts_1089110_1091210_" > But the basic process sounds like this.</a><a name="ts_1091310_1093990_" > Here&#x27;s an example where the author, Richard Schwartz,</a><a name="ts_1094190_1097152_" > describes the process of unburdening the inner critic.</a><a name="ts_1098016_1101060_" > I would have you focus on that critical voice, find it in your body.</a><a name="ts_1101380_1103980_" > Most people find that particular part in their head somewhere.</a><a name="ts_1104220_1109000_" > And I would ask you, Tammy, how do you feel toward that critical part of you?</a><a name="ts_1109120_1110820_" > And it&#x27;s likely you&#x27;d say something like, I hate it.</a><a name="ts_1111080_1113060_" > It just makes me feel like really bad.</a><a name="ts_1113060_1115660_" > And it keeps me from doing what I want to do in my life.</a><a name="ts_1115780_1116540_" > It holds me back.</a><a name="ts_1116660_1120280_" > But we would ask the ones who hate it to give us the space to get curious.</a><a name="ts_1120560_1122800_" > I wouldn&#x27;t have you talk to it until you were at least</a><a name="ts_1123260_1126040_" > had some sort of open mindedness toward it.</a><a name="ts_1126040_1128840_" > And at that point, I would have you ask it,</a><a name="ts_1129000_1131860_" > what&#x27;s it afraid would happen if it didn&#x27;t do this to you all day?</a><a name="ts_1132060_1136270_" > It&#x27;s likely you would say some version of, or you would hear without thinking,</a><a name="ts_1136590_1139610_" > you know, just wait and see what comes back to you from that part.</a><a name="ts_1139970_1143670_" > That it&#x27;s afraid if it didn&#x27;t do this to you, you&#x27;d get hurt maybe.</a><a name="ts_1143970_1145450_" > Or people would judge you.</a><a name="ts_1145590_1148590_" > Or you wouldn&#x27;t be perfect and then you&#x27;d be abandoned.</a><a name="ts_1148930_1152270_" > Or there&#x27;s always some kind of protective reason.</a><a name="ts_1152270_1157170_" > then would have you say to it, if we could go to the part of you that it protects,</a><a name="ts_1157430_1161770_" > that has been hurt in the past, and heal that so it wasn&#x27;t such a threat,</a><a name="ts_1161910_1163590_" > would this part have to keep doing this?</a><a name="ts_1163830_1166030_" > And most of the time they&#x27;ll say, no, they wouldn&#x27;t have to.</a><a name="ts_1166210_1169910_" > And I might ask, what would it like to do instead of being this critic?</a><a name="ts_1170110_1173030_" > And often, oddly enough, the answer is the opposite role.</a><a name="ts_1173230_1175590_" > So you might hear it say, I&#x27;d like to be your cheerleader.</a><a name="ts_1175790_1177310_" > I&#x27;d like to help you get out in the world.</a><a name="ts_1177310_1180330_" > I&#x27;d like to help you feel good about yourself.</a><a name="ts_1180690_1185270_" > And so we would then negotiate permission from it to go to what it protected,</a><a name="ts_1185290_1187450_" > that vulnerable hurt part.</a><a name="ts_1187590_1192090_" > And we have a process for actually unburdening that part so that it felt much,</a><a name="ts_1192150_1193430_" > much better and less vulnerable.</a><a name="ts_1193670_1197630_" > And then bring the critic in to see that what it was protecting is no longer needed.</a><a name="ts_1197870_1201230_" > Now, if we would like to shift into that, that other role,</a><a name="ts_1201410_1204030_" > that&#x27;s sort of in the nutshell of the process we do.</a><a name="ts_1204030_1207390_" > So the self unburdens the critic from needing to protect the exile,</a><a name="ts_1207530_1211392_" > and both the exile and the critic experience powerful healing.</a><a name="ts_1212064_1213420_" > Okay, so let&#x27;s go back to the self again.</a><a name="ts_1213820_1215500_" > Like again, this is my favorite part of IFS,</a><a name="ts_1215540_1219060_" > because healing happens when the self leads instead of the protectors.</a><a name="ts_1219300_1222180_" > But if the self is different from the parts, what actually is it?</a><a name="ts_1222300_1226240_" > So in No Bad Parts, Dick describes the self as a spiritual essence</a><a name="ts_1226240_1229480_" > that&#x27;s hard to describe, but easy to experience.</a><a name="ts_1230100_1233380_" > And I really hope you try the exercises that I&#x27;m going to link.</a><a name="ts_1233380_1237160_" > When you experience the self, you&#x27;re going to notice the eight C&#x27;s of self energy.</a><a name="ts_1237480_1238360_" > It&#x27;s calm.</a><a name="ts_1238660_1239660_" > It&#x27;s curious.</a><a name="ts_1240120_1241440_" > It&#x27;s compassionate.</a><a name="ts_1241620_1242960_" > It has clarity.</a><a name="ts_1242960_1245500_" > It can see situations and parts for what they are.</a><a name="ts_1245760_1246880_" > It&#x27;s confident.</a><a name="ts_1247100_1250420_" > It trusts in its own ability to lead, and it knows what&#x27;s right and wrong.</a><a name="ts_1251140_1252100_" > It&#x27;s courageous.</a><a name="ts_1252400_1255580_" > It&#x27;s willing to speak the truth, and it&#x27;s also willing to face pain.</a><a name="ts_1255900_1257000_" > It&#x27;s creative.</a><a name="ts_1257000_1258120_" > So it&#x27;s resourceful.</a><a name="ts_1258220_1259980_" > It&#x27;s not so rigid in what it does.</a><a name="ts_1259980_1261560_" > It&#x27;s also connected.</a><a name="ts_1261760_1268680_" > It feels this sense of connectedness to ourselves, to others, and to our internal world as well.</a><a name="ts_1268920_1274420_" > Beautiful reality of the self is that even if trauma has fragmented your system and major parts</a><a name="ts_1274420_1277120_" > fight each other, the self is never damaged.</a><a name="ts_1277340_1279380_" > The self is always whole.</a><a name="ts_1279700_1281060_" > You don&#x27;t need to be more calm.</a><a name="ts_1281140_1282740_" > A part of you is already calm.</a><a name="ts_1283060_1284680_" > You don&#x27;t need to be more courageous.</a><a name="ts_1284680_1287160_" > A part of you already is courageous.</a><a name="ts_1287460_1290860_" > So by its nature, the self is this deep source of healing.</a><a name="ts_1291380_1292620_" > You can think of it like the sun.</a><a name="ts_1292740_1296000_" > Even when the storm clouds blacken the sky, the sun is there.</a><a name="ts_1296120_1298816_" > It&#x27;s ready to break through with love and light.</a><a name="ts_1299424_1300350_" > So Schwartz writes,</a><a name="ts_1300350_1305310_" > Every part of our personality that we do not love will become hostile to us.</a><a name="ts_1305450_1310050_" > When you feel angry or afraid of one of your parts, you can know that that&#x27;s not the self.</a><a name="ts_1310230_1312270_" > That&#x27;s how the parts react to each other.</a><a name="ts_1312430_1316850_" > But when your self steps in to listen to all of your parts with kindness and curiosity,</a><a name="ts_1316850_1320960_" > it creates space for healing the whole internal family system.</a><a name="ts_1321568_1325910_" > The self listens to your protectors, building trust so that they can soften their roles.</a><a name="ts_1325910_1330350_" > It connects with exiles, it witnesses their pain, and it helps them release their burdens.</a><a name="ts_1330650_1335070_" > When the self brings compassion and curiosity to all the parts, it gains their trust so they</a><a name="ts_1335070_1336130_" > can soften their roles.</a><a name="ts_1336430_1339590_" > Now, you might be thinking, this sounds too good to be true.</a><a name="ts_1339770_1343310_" > But I don&#x27;t want you to take my word for it.</a><a name="ts_1343510_1347410_" > I want you to try some of these exercises and just experience it for yourself.</a><a name="ts_1347630_1348350_" > Here&#x27;s what you&#x27;ll find.</a><a name="ts_1348530_1349250_" > Here&#x27;s what Dick says.</a><a name="ts_1349790_1355410_" > Within each of us is a wise, compassionate essence of goodness that knows how to relate harmoniously.</a><a name="ts_1355410_1360430_" > In addition, we are not one messed up mind, but an internal system of parts.</a><a name="ts_1360990_1366050_" > Sure, these parts can be sometimes disruptive or harmful, but once they&#x27;re unburdened,</a><a name="ts_1366270_1368190_" > they return to their essential goodness.</a><a name="ts_1368550_1373870_" > I know this sounds like a lot, but making this paradigm shift doesn&#x27;t require huge sacrifices or</a><a name="ts_1373870_1374270_" > suffering.</a><a name="ts_1374450_1379430_" > It can be really painful to retrieve these parts of yourself that you left in the dust,</a><a name="ts_1379570_1381310_" > but the effort&#x27;s worth it.</a><a name="ts_1381410_1383810_" > Here&#x27;s just a taste of what you have to gain.</a><a name="ts_1383810_1389910_" > You&#x27;re going to feel more love for yourself and others, more access to your inner joy and delight,</a><a name="ts_1390210_1395070_" > as well as your rich sadness and grief, and more meaningful habits and activities</a><a name="ts_1395070_1397408_" > with a sense of fulfilling vision.</a><a name="ts_1398304_1401150_" > So, how can we make this something we actually practice?</a><a name="ts_1401150_1402880_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_1402880_1405170_" > You connect with your parts through daily practice.</a><a name="ts_1405350_1409350_" > It&#x27;s like a meditation, or you could even do it on paper.</a><a name="ts_1409470_1411930_" > You spend a few minutes each day checking in with your parts.</a><a name="ts_1411930_1417850_" > You practice listening to them and taking time to touch in with yourself, your curious, calm,</a><a name="ts_1418130_1419590_" > compassionate, courageous self.</a><a name="ts_1419730_1423584_" > And then as you practice this, your inner world becomes more harmonious.</a><a name="ts_1424160_1428470_" > And I think it&#x27;s easy to see how, on a global scale, countries and their leaders react</a><a name="ts_1428470_1431530_" > to inner exiles and protectors with violence.</a><a name="ts_1431930_1435488_" > But as we heal our inner worlds, we can also make the world a better place.</a><a name="ts_1435488_1436544_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1436544_1442990_" > This experience of turning toward your own exiles with gentleness helps build</a><a name="ts_1442990_1445870_" > the muscle to turn toward others with empathy.</a><a name="ts_1445870_1450110_" > And that softens relationships and heals families and, I would say, even communities.</a><a name="ts_1450450_1453970_" > So, every step of self-leadership sends out these ripples of healing.</a><a name="ts_1454230_1457470_" > So, in that sense, cultivating the self isn&#x27;t just personal growth.</a><a name="ts_1457690_1459840_" > It&#x27;s an act of service to the world.</a><a name="ts_1460448_1465030_" > So, I personally found the process of IFS to be really powerful in my own life.</a><a name="ts_1465170_1469210_" > And I hope you try some of the exercises so that you can experience this inner shift yourself.</a><a name="ts_1469810_1474490_" > Make sure to watch this channel for the next couple of videos that I put out with IFS exercises.</a><a name="ts_1474750_1477830_" > And let me know in the comments if there&#x27;s any other books or therapy methods</a><a name="ts_1477830_1479610_" > that you&#x27;d like me to make a video about.</a><a name="ts_1480010_1483690_" > Thank you so much for watching and please take care.</a><a name="ts_1483690_1486610_" > Hi there! If you found anything in this video helpful,</a><a name="ts_1486630_1489610_" > I would really appreciate it if you could give it a thumbs up</a><a name="ts_1489610_1492410_" > or share it with someone who could benefit from it today.</a></p></div></body>
