Or you feel numb inside, like you can&#x27;t really feel anything.</a><a name="ts_6550_11110_S00" > Good stuff happens and you feel zilch, like food doesn&#x27;t taste good anymore.</a><a name="ts_11490_17664_S00" > Maybe you have no motivation. Or you feel like just curling up into a ball, never moving again.</a><a name="ts_18336_22660_S00" > Don&#x27;t want to be around anyone and you just shut down. Or maybe everything seems fine in life,</a><a name="ts_22680_27560_S00" > like you have a good job, good friends, but you just can&#x27;t feel any joy in it. Now some might describe</a><a name="ts_27560_31820_S00" > this as depression, but there&#x27;s another way to look at it. From a nervous system perspective,</a><a name="ts_31900_36880_S00" > this is called hypoarousal, the dorsal vagal response, or the shutdown state. And it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_36880_42500_S00" > closely related to trauma, especially childhood trauma. In this video we&#x27;re going to explore how</a><a name="ts_42500_48200_S00" > our nervous system&#x27;s response to fear, adversity, or trauma can get stuck in our body and trigger</a><a name="ts_48200_52140_S00" > depression. And the good news is that this understanding opens up some great treatment</a><a name="ts_52140_60440_S00" > options for both trauma and depression. Real quick, we have to talk about what causes depression.</a><a name="ts_60440_66840_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:00]</span> In the past there&#x27;s been an overly simplified view of depression, that it was laziness or a simple</a><a name="ts_66840_72960_S00" > chemical imbalance. So the theory of low serotonin, for example, that&#x27;s been disproven. But the truth</a><a name="ts_72960_79180_S00" > is that depression is probably many different diseases with various underlying problems, and then</a><a name="ts_79180_85320_S00" > the symptoms show up as depression. So why would underlying causes from grief to trauma to low self-esteem</a><a name="ts_85320_91380_S00" > to thyroid disorders or Lyme disease all show up with this same cluster of symptoms? Depression</a><a name="ts_91380_96520_S00" > is a universal response. We can find it in every country in the world, in modern first world office</a><a name="ts_96520_101780_S00" > workers, and in hunter-gatherer societies. We can find it in the rich and in the poor, the physically</a><a name="ts_101780_108580_S00" > healthy and the sick. So far from being a simple physical condition, depression expert Charles Raisin has</a><a name="ts_108580_114860_S00" > said that one thing that all the forms of depression have in common is that depression is a universal</a><a name="ts_114860_122120_S00" > response to being overwhelmed. It&#x27;s when the internal and external pressures trigger a switch in our</a><a name="ts_122120_129060_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:02]</span> brain and body from, I can handle this, to I can&#x27;t handle this. This is a subconscious survival response</a><a name="ts_129060_133800_S00" > in our nervous system. This is a flip that gets switched in our nervous system, and it can be really</a><a name="ts_133800_138640_S00" > hard to unflip that switch. Let&#x27;s use an example of childhood trauma. Let&#x27;s say that as a child you</a><a name="ts_138640_144000_S00" > saw your parents fight a lot, and sometimes those fights would turn violent. Now this feels terribly</a><a name="ts_144000_149240_S00" > dangerous for a kid, because it is. Now if your dad was hurting your mom, maybe you tried to fight him</a><a name="ts_149240_154040_S00" > off to stop him, but that didn&#x27;t work and it actually put you in more danger because he was too strong.</a><a name="ts_154180_159560_S00" > If you tried to run for help, you&#x27;d be punished worse. That would put you in more danger. Freezing up and</a><a name="ts_159560_165800_S00" > watching them was also dangerous. So as a child all you could do was withdraw and hide in your room.</a><a name="ts_165920_171320_S00" > If this happened enough times, or if the trauma was severe enough, or if you were a sensitive soul,</a><a name="ts_171380_177760_S00" > you would do anything you could to distract yourself or numb the pain. Maybe you would daydream. Maybe you</a><a name="ts_177760_184540_S00" > would turn on a show to escape. When there&#x27;s nothing we can do to stop the danger or to escape it,</a><a name="ts_184540_190780_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:04]</span> your nervous system protects you by making you detach. And the threats don&#x27;t have to be physical.</a><a name="ts_191040_196260_S00" > It could be caused by emotional threats as well. One of my followers said, I learned that no matter</a><a name="ts_196260_201140_S00" > how hard I tried, I would be belittled, insulted, misunderstood, and cast in a negative light.</a><a name="ts_201180_206440_S00" > It made me hesitant to do literally anything, spending hours, days, years in bed scared of what</a><a name="ts_206440_211480_S00" > would happen and how I&#x27;d be treated, ruminating on everything I&#x27;d done would do wrong, and feeling</a><a name="ts_211480_217340_S00" > defeated to the point of no longer trying. Chronically feeling unsafe emotionally or physically</a><a name="ts_217340_223060_S00" > wears us down and can trigger depression. So what&#x27;s going on in the nervous system here? Our nervous</a><a name="ts_223060_228460_S00" > system has different levels of response to threat, each serving a specific purpose. Our default state</a><a name="ts_228460_234260_S00" > is the ventral vagal state. This is feeling calm, safe, and connected. This parasympathetic state lets us</a><a name="ts_234260_240200_S00" > rest, digest, and experience joy. When faced with a threat that we believe we can handle, we enter a</a><a name="ts_240200_246080_S00" > sympathetic state. So a small threat leads to a fight response, which is increased energy. A bigger</a><a name="ts_246080_252140_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:06]</span> threat leads to a flight response, where we&#x27;re going to escape. And an even bigger threat leads to a freeze</a><a name="ts_252140_258540_S00" > response, where you&#x27;re immobilized but very alert. When we perceive a situation as completely overwhelming</a><a name="ts_258540_267040_S00" > or inescapable, our body switches to the dorsal vagal state, also known as hypoarousal or the shutdown state.</a><a name="ts_267040_272920_S00" > This is when your body conserves energy. Your heart rate and your blood pressure drop. You feel numb,</a><a name="ts_273140_279800_S00" > exhausted, or depressed. You may disconnect from others, maybe even disconnect from yourself. This</a><a name="ts_279800_284740_S00" > isn&#x27;t just like a psychological response. It&#x27;s not just in your head. It&#x27;s measurable in your body.</a><a name="ts_285180_291460_S00" > Scientists call it tonic immobility in animals, and in humans it often shows up as depression. Whether this is</a><a name="ts_291460_296480_S00" > triggered by a single traumatic event or by chronic stress, this state is your body&#x27;s way of protecting</a><a name="ts_296480_302120_S00" > you when it believes there&#x27;s no other way out. Hypoarousal is a survival response. It&#x27;s when your</a><a name="ts_302120_309880_S00" > body flips a switch from I can overcome this to all my efforts seem pointless. Let&#x27;s just conserve our energy.</a><a name="ts_310020_315280_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:10]</span> Okay, one of my subscribers said, in my experience depression is when you can no longer muster the energy</a><a name="ts_315280_320820_S00" > it takes to hope. It&#x27;s what happens when fighting your trauma has just created more trauma and one</a><a name="ts_320820_327240_S00" > day you wake up unwilling to fight anymore. It&#x27;s just too exhausting. Now this state of hypoarousal or</a><a name="ts_327240_334400_S00" > dorsal vagal response, this state can get triggered by one extreme trauma like being kidnapped or by a low</a><a name="ts_334400_340260_S00" > level but chronic stress like constantly fighting discrimination in society. It can be triggered by the</a><a name="ts_340260_345220_S00" > death of a loved one. This is an overwhelming loss that you can&#x27;t fight your way out of. Or it can be</a><a name="ts_345220_351760_S00" > caused by being stressed out and overwhelmed for too long by bills or work or family problems or by a</a><a name="ts_351760_357220_S00" > stream of negative thoughts telling you that you&#x27;re worthless. And it can be caused by hypervigilance from</a><a name="ts_357220_365760_S00" > past trauma. Lovely M said, trauma causes an inability to feel safe, always being on the alert. It feels exhausting</a><a name="ts_365760_372000_S00" > and depleting and as if you cannot enjoy life, as if you&#x27;re always on hypervigilant mode waiting for the</a><a name="ts_372000_378460_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:12]</span> other shoe to drop. And Sophia said, trying to stay calm with a hair-triggered alarm system is exhausting.</a><a name="ts_378700_385600_S00" > Now this nervous system reaction, this shutdown response, is not a disorder. It&#x27;s an instinctual response</a><a name="ts_385600_392560_S00" > to protect you from pain and from harm and to attempt to force you to rest and recover. You&#x27;ll see animals do</a><a name="ts_392560_397640_S00" > this when they&#x27;re trapped or they&#x27;re overwhelmed by a predator. And if this is how you survived as a child,</a><a name="ts_397740_403100_S00" > then you may have developed the habit of slipping into that state in order to protect yourself from</a><a name="ts_403100_408980_S00" > other stressors or trauma. So ask yourself this question. Did shutting down protect you in some way</a><a name="ts_408980_416700_S00" > when you experienced trauma? Did going quiet or hiding or withdrawing protect you from some hurt? Whether it was</a><a name="ts_416700_421560_S00" > physical abuse that you couldn&#x27;t fight off or conflict with your parents or hiding from shame and</a><a name="ts_421560_427140_S00" > embarrassment. Shutting down can be an effective survival response as a child. It&#x27;s a learned</a><a name="ts_427140_432280_S00" > habit that&#x27;s hard to get out of and it looks a whole lot like depression. Another follower said,</a><a name="ts_432380_437880_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:12]</span> I think trauma, even the less heavy forms of it, pushes your life away from what you want and your values</a><a name="ts_437880_444020_S00" > toward something that you think you need to be safe. This happens unconsciously and in the end you live a</a><a name="ts_444020_450260_S00" > life that might be good on paper that you don&#x27;t really like, but you have no idea why or why it feels off.</a><a name="ts_450260_454960_S00" > I think deep down you feel torn inside, but you have no idea how to mend it. So as we explore</a><a name="ts_454960_460600_S00" > hypoarousal, it becomes clear that this is a form of dissociation. The body&#x27;s protecting you from pain.</a><a name="ts_460720_465540_S00" > It&#x27;s totally functional if you&#x27;re a gazelle getting chewed on by a cheetah. It prevents the gazelle from</a><a name="ts_465540_470480_S00" > feeling much pain. And in some situations, like this video shows, it provides the gazelle a chance to</a><a name="ts_470480_476860_S00" > escape and survive. Okay, so the shutdown response serves a function, okay? Let me give you another example.</a><a name="ts_476860_481540_S00" > How about low-level chronic threat? Let&#x27;s say someone&#x27;s facing slow starvation. There&#x27;s a</a><a name="ts_481540_486680_S00" > famine in the land. The dorsal vagal response numbs you to the pain of hunger. It dulls your appetite</a><a name="ts_486680_491980_S00" > and it conserves energy by slowing down your heart rate, breathing, and metabolism. This shutdown response</a><a name="ts_491980_497120_S00" > could help you survive until food is available again. But most of us aren&#x27;t in a famine. Getting stuck</a><a name="ts_497120_502360_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:17]</span> in a dorsal vagal response is totally not functional if your negative thoughts trapped you in the state of being</a><a name="ts_502360_507380_S00" > unable to leave your bed. So let&#x27;s just talk real quickly about what hypoarousal feels like. Here&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_507380_513000_S00" > the Venn diagram. Symptoms of depression include worthlessness or guilt, restlessness or irritability,</a><a name="ts_513180_518800_S00" > body aches and pain, or suicidal thoughts. Symptoms of hypoarousal include muscle weakness,</a><a name="ts_518980_525120_S00" > poor coordination, decreased sensitivity to stimuli like hot and cold, and a low heart rate. Now symptoms of</a><a name="ts_525120_530560_S00" > both, we&#x27;re gonna see the overlap here, include feeling numb, detached, overwhelmed, low motivation,</a><a name="ts_530560_536320_S00" > feeling frozen, hopeless, helpless, sad, or apathetic, difficulty moving, fatigue, brain fog, poor sleep,</a><a name="ts_536360_542120_S00" > or social withdrawal. So if that sounds like you, let&#x27;s talk about what we can do about it. Depression</a><a name="ts_542120_547480_S00" > isn&#x27;t caused by trauma for everyone. Your body can get overwhelmed and trigger that shutdown response</a><a name="ts_547480_553320_S00" > from other situations like a physical illness or outside circumstances where you lack the resources</a><a name="ts_553320_559420_S00" > to feel safe. But when we look at how common trauma is and how closely it&#x27;s connected with depression,</a><a name="ts_559420_564580_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:09:19]</span> it&#x27;s probably caused by a form of hypoarousal for a lot of people. The ACEs study explored the</a><a name="ts_564580_569360_S00" > connection between childhood trauma and depression, and people with four or more adverse childhood</a><a name="ts_569360_574880_S00" > experiences were more than three times as likely to develop depression than someone without childhood</a><a name="ts_574880_579340_S00" > trauma. Okay, here&#x27;s another question you might be asking. What if it doesn&#x27;t seem like you&#x27;ve dealt</a><a name="ts_579340_586180_S00" > with any huge threat? Now, sometimes we subconsciously create our own overwhelming threat by sending</a><a name="ts_586180_591580_S00" > ourselves little messages over and over that train your brain to feel hopeless. So this includes thinking</a><a name="ts_591580_596820_S00" > things like, this will never work out. I&#x27;d better expect the worst so I don&#x27;t get disappointed. I&#x27;m such</a><a name="ts_596820_604840_S00" > a failure. Why bother trying? I&#x27;ll just mess up again. Or people, all of them, are so awful. This world is so</a><a name="ts_604840_610320_S00" > cruel. Everything is worse than it ever was. Can you see how constantly thinking like this on repeat</a><a name="ts_610320_615840_S00" > is going to make you feel like it&#x27;s pointless to keep trying? Our nervous system does not care if it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_615840_620040_S00" > a real threat or a perceived threat, something in our mind. When we visualize something threatening or</a><a name="ts_620040_625240_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:10:20]</span> overwhelming, it triggers the exact same physiological response in our nervous system. This is why watching a</a><a name="ts_625240_629840_S00" > scary movie can make your hands sweaty, but you&#x27;re actually safe. Your brain is perceiving danger and</a><a name="ts_629840_635360_S00" > turning on that fight or flight response, or in the case of this, the shutdown response. Also, things</a><a name="ts_635360_640760_S00" > that seem very small to an adult can seem completely overwhelming to a child. A parent laughing at you,</a><a name="ts_640860_646520_S00" > a friend bullying you, a peer rejecting you, a teacher correcting you. This small t trauma can add up over</a><a name="ts_646520_651880_S00" > time to reinforce the shutdown response because you just don&#x27;t feel safe. Now, you may have developed a</a><a name="ts_651880_658000_S00" > habit of slipping into that state in order to protect yourself from other stressors. It&#x27;s a learned</a><a name="ts_658000_663760_S00" > habit that&#x27;s hard to get out of. School is stressful? Numb out and detach. I don&#x27;t care about school.</a><a name="ts_664020_668480_S00" > You get in a fight with your parents? Oh well, I don&#x27;t care about my parents. Right? Nobody likes me</a><a name="ts_668480_673380_S00" > anyway. I&#x27;m not going to try. Let&#x27;s say your parents are critical of you. I&#x27;ll never match their expectations,</a><a name="ts_673380_679060_S00" > so why bother trying? Right? There&#x27;s a lot of ways we numb out and detach ourselves to try and protect</a><a name="ts_679060_685100_S00" > ourselves from pain. Also, when we constantly perceive danger all around us or we lack the safety net of loving</a><a name="ts_685100_689860_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:11:25]</span> and supportive family, our nervous system can literally flip a switch to the dorsal vagal</a><a name="ts_689860_694880_S00" > response, leaving us feeling depressed, numb, or helpless. And when that&#x27;s happened over and over,</a><a name="ts_695000_701980_S00" > especially in childhood, this can wire our brain to be more likely to be depressed. Okay, so if depression</a><a name="ts_701980_707080_S00" > is fueled by trauma, how can we treat it? Slipping into a shutdown response isn&#x27;t something you&#x27;re doing</a><a name="ts_707080_712280_S00" > on purpose. It&#x27;s not your fault, but there is something you can do about it. You can build up the ability</a><a name="ts_712280_717580_S00" > ability to have more of a say about what your nervous system does and how it reacts. So let&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_717580_721820_S00" > talk about four ways to do that. First thing we&#x27;re going to do is build awareness. Let&#x27;s learn to notice</a><a name="ts_721820_727560_S00" > what&#x27;s going on in your body. So when you can notice what the signs are that you&#x27;re in a state of</a><a name="ts_728180_734480_S00" > hypoarousal, you can name that state. So you can say, oh, I&#x27;m noticing that I&#x27;m in the shutdown state. Now</a><a name="ts_734480_739480_S00" > this is a lot easier with a therapist who&#x27;s informed in somatic or polyvagal theory. So in session,</a><a name="ts_739480_745000_S00" > I would say something like, hey, I noticed that you&#x27;re going quiet. Your body looks like it&#x27;s kind</a><a name="ts_745000_750760_S00" > of slumped, or you&#x27;re curling up into a ball on my couch. What are you noticing? It seems like you&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_750760_756160_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:30]</span> feeling a little overwhelmed. Are you starting to think that everything is hopeless? Now if my client</a><a name="ts_756160_761280_S00" > in that situation was super dissociated, we might spend the whole session exploring that numbness,</a><a name="ts_761300_767500_S00" > and then also what connectedness to the present moment is like. So I might say something like, I might grab a</a><a name="ts_767500_773660_S00" > stone. I have like all these random things in my desk. I might grab like a stone like this and hand</a><a name="ts_773660_778620_S00" > it to them and be like, hey, can you hold this? Can you feel this in your hands? Or I would have</a><a name="ts_778620_784500_S00" > them practice grounding themselves in their senses. What can you feel, right? What do your pants feel like</a><a name="ts_784500_789720_S00" > right now? What can you see in this room? What can you hear? And I would have them describe it in detail.</a><a name="ts_789840_796220_S00" > So that&#x27;s the first step to overcoming this dorsal vagal response. Now the next step is to add in some movement.</a><a name="ts_796220_801220_S00" > So when we understand that depression might be a nervous system state, we understand that to go</a><a name="ts_801220_807500_S00" > from hypoarousal to safety, we have to move through activation. One of the best treatments for hypoarousal</a><a name="ts_807500_813360_S00" > is physical movement. And interestingly enough, tons of research shows that exercise is one of the most</a><a name="ts_813360_818980_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:13:33]</span> effective treatments for depression. So we show our brain that we are safe and capable by moving our body.</a><a name="ts_819160_824180_S00" > In a session, I might ask a client to do some physical movement. Can you pat your legs? Can you sit up with</a><a name="ts_824180_828080_S00" > your back straight? I mean, of course, doing aerobic exercise for like 40 minutes a day is ideal,</a><a name="ts_828120_835760_S00" > but simple things like making your body big, shaking your arms, jiggling your legs, laughing really hard,</a><a name="ts_835920_842240_S00" > dancing, yoga, a five-minute walk, all of these things tell your body that here in this moment you</a><a name="ts_842240_847140_S00" > are safe and capable. And that sends a message to your nervous system, and you can start feeling better</a><a name="ts_847140_855230_S00" > emotionally. Other things you can try include like quick intense breathing. So like notice how that&#x27;s very</a><a name="ts_855230_861250_S00" > different from the slow breathing that triggers like more calm nervous system. Sing some upbeat music,</a><a name="ts_861410_866510_S00" > use an engaged posture, hold yourself up big, right? Find something that&#x27;ll make you laugh hard,</a><a name="ts_866510_872090_S00" > or try eating some crunchy or spicy foods. All of these things can help you re-engage with your senses.</a><a name="ts_872290_878250_S00" > Now we&#x27;re not fighting our body here, right? We&#x27;re learning to listen to your body and reconnect with it.</a><a name="ts_878350_884210_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:14:38]</span> The signals it&#x27;s sending is okay. The goal is to restore your sense of safety, which includes your ability</a><a name="ts_884210_888790_S00" > ability to overcome threats or challenges. And that can help flip that switch back up to like,</a><a name="ts_888850_893310_S00" > okay, I can do this. I can face this. Okay, and that&#x27;s the third step, right? The third step is asking,</a><a name="ts_893410_897690_S00" > how do you show your nervous system that you are safe and capable? When it knows this, it&#x27;s going to</a><a name="ts_897690_902650_S00" > automatically return to a sense of safety. You could say something to yourself like, I know that as a child</a><a name="ts_903070_909630_S00" > withdrawing kept you safe, but now you&#x27;re an adult. You&#x27;re safe here and now. You can solve this problem by</a><a name="ts_909630_916370_S00" > facing it. Now acting on this might look like facing your fears or solving problems or leaving a toxic</a><a name="ts_916370_921090_S00" > environment. So for example, if you&#x27;re in an abusive relationship, you leave. If you&#x27;re drowning in</a><a name="ts_921090_925770_S00" > stress at work, you sit down and you make a plan to create a more sustainable approach. If you&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_925770_931230_S00" > struggling with debt, let&#x27;s make one small change. Let&#x27;s make a budget or cancel one subscription. When you</a><a name="ts_931230_936610_S00" > take any action, even small ones, even when you don&#x27;t feel like it, that&#x27;s movement and it sends a message to</a><a name="ts_936610_942390_S00" > your brain that you are safe and capable, and that can help your nervous system reset to be more active.</a><a name="ts_942710_946830_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:15:42]</span> Psychologists call this behavioral activation, and it is one of the most effective treatments for</a><a name="ts_946830_952290_S00" > depression, and understanding polyvagal theory explains why. The action makes your nervous system</a><a name="ts_952290_957490_S00" > move up a level from the shutdown to the sympathetic state, and this starts a feedback loop in your brain</a><a name="ts_957490_963130_S00" > and body, and most likely you&#x27;ll begin to feel more energetic and more motivated. Now I understand this can</a><a name="ts_963130_967470_S00" > seem really impossible to do on your own, so of course I&#x27;d recommend that if you can do this work</a><a name="ts_967470_973230_S00" > with a therapist to help break this down into tiny steps. There&#x27;s another way to show your brain that</a><a name="ts_973230_979130_S00" > you have enough support to overcome challenges. So often it&#x27;s the perception that things are hopeless,</a><a name="ts_979130_986010_S00" > not actually reality. So a few ways that we remind our brain that we&#x27;re actually safe, we convince our brain</a><a name="ts_986010_993110_S00" > to change its perception. Some of these practices like gratitude practice, right? You remember and you pay attention to the good things in your</a><a name="ts_993110_997070_S00" > life. Or the three good things exercise, where you remind yourself of the good things that you do.</a><a name="ts_997070_1002190_S00" > Or you surround yourself with supportive people. So one of the most effective ways to stop a trauma response</a><a name="ts_1002190_1008310_S00" > is to connect, to make eye contact with, and hug a safe and supportive human being or an animal, because this</a><a name="ts_1008310_1013030_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:16:48]</span> sends a message to your nervous system that you are safe. So the more messages our nervous system receives</a><a name="ts_1013030_1018330_S00" > that we&#x27;re safe, when we perceive safety by remembering all the good in our life, that helps our brain be like,</a><a name="ts_1018330_1023650_S00" > okay, actually I am capable. I can overcome this. And it&#x27;ll flip that switch back up into safe mode.</a><a name="ts_1023870_1030190_S00" > Okay, number four. Lastly, sometimes the hypoarousal response is your body&#x27;s message that you need to</a><a name="ts_1030190_1036690_S00" > rest and take a break. You might just actually be worn down. Sometimes you need to give yourself time</a><a name="ts_1037180_1044590_S00" > to rest and recover. Give yourself grace and compassion. Allow yourself to mourn and feel sad and process an old</a><a name="ts_1044590_1050570_S00" > hurt so that you can move through it and come out on top. During this time of rest and recovery, you</a><a name="ts_1050570_1055950_S00" > want to fill your body with good nutrients. Give it gentle movement. Treat yourself with love. Surround</a><a name="ts_1055950_1061270_S00" > yourself with supportive people. Take time to rest and curl up on the couch and read a book, right? All of</a><a name="ts_1061270_1066730_S00" > these things can send a message to your nervous system that you are safe. Now with all four of these</a><a name="ts_1066730_1072670_S00" > practices, you can return to the ventral vagal or the safe and sound state of your nervous system. When we look</a><a name="ts_1072670_1077270_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:17:52]</span> at depression from a nervous system perspective, it gives us permission to be gentle with ourselves,</a><a name="ts_1077270_1081990_S00" > to understand where these feelings are coming from and some practical ways to work through them.</a><a name="ts_1082110_1086950_S00" > We&#x27;re going to notice what&#x27;s going on in our bodies, add in some movement, build your sense of safety,</a><a name="ts_1086970_1091910_S00" > and take time to replenish your resources. If you&#x27;re dealing with trauma and depression, I hope this helps</a><a name="ts_1091910_1098730_S00" > you take a small step today toward better mental health. And if you&#x27;re ready to take bigger steps or to learn</a><a name="ts_1098730_1104150_S00" > the essential skills to work through emotions, to process them, and to build your mental health and</a><a name="ts_1104150_1109690_S00" > resilience, you can join my membership.
