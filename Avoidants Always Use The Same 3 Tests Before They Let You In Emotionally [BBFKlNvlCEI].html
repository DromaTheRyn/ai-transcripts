ghosting.</a><a name="ts_11440_14480_S01" > These are tests happening right under your nose.</a><a name="ts_14600_17620_S01" > And if you&#x27;re not careful, you&#x27;ll miss them completely.</a><a name="ts_17900_20780_S01" > And once you understand everything about what they are,</a><a name="ts_21180_24200_S01" > everything in your relationship will start to make sense.</a><a name="ts_24640_28200_S01" > All right, so test number one is running the pain gauntlet.</a><a name="ts_28660_32700_S01" > So I was reading psychology today and recently stumbled across</a><a name="ts_32700_37240_S01" > this little excerpt from Hal Shorey, a clinical psychologist.</a><a name="ts_37240_40580_S01" > He says, if you want to stay in the relationship,</a><a name="ts_40580_45800_S01" > you should always be aware that you may also have to endure some testing behaviors.</a><a name="ts_46060_52020_S01" > The person with the fearful style may engage in some negative or challenging behaviors</a><a name="ts_52020_55200_S01" > to see if you are going to reject or hurt them.</a><a name="ts_55200_60240_S01" > So basically, they&#x27;re going to run you through what I like to call a pain gauntlet.</a><a name="ts_60400_61460_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:01:00]</span> Now, it&#x27;s interesting.</a><a name="ts_61640_66120_S01" > The phrase run the gauntlet is rooted in the 17th century,</a><a name="ts_66120_70740_S01" > where a party judged guilty was forced to run between two rows of soldiers</a><a name="ts_70740_74160_S01" > who strike out and attack them with sticks or other weapons.</a><a name="ts_74320_75700_S01" > And the thinking was simple.</a><a name="ts_75880_79680_S01" > Make it through the two rows of soldiers alive and you&#x27;d be let off free,</a><a name="ts_80160_81960_S01" > perish, and well, you&#x27;re dead.</a><a name="ts_81960_85020_S01" > And since you were judged guilty, justice has been served.</a><a name="ts_85280_90920_S01" > Now, obviously, avoidance don&#x27;t put the people they&#x27;re with through a physical gauntlet,</a><a name="ts_90920_93520_S01" > but they do put them through an emotional one.</a><a name="ts_93700_94360_S01" > Imagine this.</a><a name="ts_94600_96860_S01" > You&#x27;re going through the early stages of a relationship,</a><a name="ts_96860_100280_S01" > and suddenly the person you&#x27;re dating starts pulling back.</a><a name="ts_100520_104060_S01" > They might cancel plans without reason, ignore your calls,</a><a name="ts_104080_107600_S01" > or seem distant just when things were going well.</a><a name="ts_107600_112440_S01" > It feels like you&#x27;ve been thrown into this unexpected challenge where the rules are unclear</a><a name="ts_112440_114860_S01" > and your emotional endurance is being tested.</a><a name="ts_115160_116100_S01" > Now, here&#x27;s the thing.</a><a name="ts_116260_117740_S01" > There&#x27;s no warning.</a><a name="ts_118060_119740_S01" > One day, things are going perfectly.</a><a name="ts_120100_121840_S01" > The next, they&#x27;re completely cold.</a><a name="ts_122120_125360_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:02:02]</span> It&#x27;s like a door slamming shut in a silent room.</a><a name="ts_125480_129420_S01" > You&#x27;re left standing there wondering what just happened.</a><a name="ts_130176_133120_S01" > Well, you found yourself running the pain gauntlet.</a><a name="ts_133320_136600_S01" > It&#x27;s not about survival in a literal sense.</a><a name="ts_136600_139220_S01" > It&#x27;s about survival of the relationship.</a><a name="ts_139560_143580_S01" > The avoidant will push you to see how much you can endure.</a><a name="ts_143840_149120_S01" > They&#x27;ll withdraw affection, become inconsistent, even criticize you subtly,</a><a name="ts_149240_152680_S01" > all while closely watching your reaction.</a><a name="ts_153160_153680_S01" > Why, though?</a><a name="ts_153880_159220_S01" > Why put someone they supposedly care about through this insane test?</a><a name="ts_159440_164180_S01" > Well, it comes down to their core wound, their overwhelming need for independence.</a><a name="ts_164180_167220_S01" > The need didn&#x27;t just appear out of nowhere.</a><a name="ts_167220_170680_S01" > It&#x27;s actually rooted in their early childhood experiences.</a><a name="ts_171220_174700_S01" > As a child, they likely received inconsistent care.</a><a name="ts_174860_179120_S01" > One moment, a caregiver might have soothed them, showing comfort and safety.</a><a name="ts_179240_183240_S01" > The next, the same caregiver might have gotten angrier, impatient,</a><a name="ts_183380_185960_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:03]</span> expecting the child to deal with things on their own.</a><a name="ts_186500_190880_S01" > Erica Komazar, a licensed clinical social worker who I had the pleasure of interviewing,</a><a name="ts_190880_194440_S01" > ties this concept into sailing through the Caribbean.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_194680_195780_S00" >S00: <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:14]</span> Babies are born.</a><a name="ts_196700_200040_S00" > It&#x27;s like being on a sailboat in the Atlantic.</a><a name="ts_200832_203670_S00" > What mothers do is they bring babies back to the Caribbean.</a><a name="ts_203930_207090_S00" > It&#x27;s not this, because that would be strange and depressed.</a><a name="ts_207470_208490_S00" > It&#x27;s like this.</a></p><p ><a name="ts_208810_212290_S01" >S01: <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:28]</span> So essentially what she&#x27;s saying is that from a very young age,</a><a name="ts_212410_216870_S01" > avoidants had to learn to create their own Caribbean of sorts,</a><a name="ts_216870_220310_S01" > because their caregivers did such a poor job at it.</a><a name="ts_220450_221810_S01" > So what do avoidants learn?</a><a name="ts_222150_225310_S01" > Well, they learn that closeness is unreliable,</a><a name="ts_225430_230670_S01" > that leaning on others is dangerous because it can turn into rejection at any moment.</a><a name="ts_230870_233970_S01" > So as adults, they recreate this pattern,</a><a name="ts_234230_237750_S01" > putting those closest to them through the same emotional whiplash.</a><a name="ts_237910_241570_S01" > It&#x27;s a way of protecting themselves from the fear of being let down again.</a><a name="ts_241570_247290_S01" > The goal here, though likely unconscious, is to confirm their very worst fear.</a><a name="ts_247490_251930_S01" > That anyone who gets close enough will eventually leave.</a><a name="ts_252736_255550_S01" > In the avoidant&#x27;s mind, every blow they deal,</a><a name="ts_255650_259050_S01" > whether it&#x27;s emotional coldness, withdrawal, or rejection,</a><a name="ts_259430_262310_S01" > it&#x27;s like a test to see how you&#x27;re going to respond.</a><a name="ts_262710_264450_S01" > Will you still stick around?</a><a name="ts_264650_268410_S01" > Or will you confirm what they&#x27;ve always believed all along?</a><a name="ts_268410_274030_S01" > That no one can handle the real them, and love always ends in abandonment.</a><a name="ts_274210_277850_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:34]</span> The longer you endure this emotional gauntlet without running away,</a><a name="ts_278010_282270_S01" > the more they might start to believe that maybe, just maybe, you&#x27;re different.</a><a name="ts_282810_284430_S01" > Maybe you won&#x27;t hurt them.</a><a name="ts_284530_285910_S01" > And it makes sense, right?</a><a name="ts_286070_288490_S01" > But even talking about this is a little ironic.</a><a name="ts_289210_293050_S01" > I mean, it&#x27;s incredibly taxing on the other person in the relationship.</a><a name="ts_293090_295890_S01" > Because while you&#x27;re trying to prove your loyalty,</a><a name="ts_295890_300790_S01" > it feels like you&#x27;re sacrificing a part of yourself just to be in this situation.</a><a name="ts_300790_304510_S01" > And I don&#x27;t want anyone to think that this behavior is normal.</a><a name="ts_304590_305690_S01" > It&#x27;s not.</a><a name="ts_305990_308530_S01" > In fact, it&#x27;s borderline abusive.</a><a name="ts_308590_310050_S01" > But I&#x27;m going to slow my roll here.</a><a name="ts_310170_311830_S01" > We&#x27;ll talk a lot about this later.</a><a name="ts_312030_316050_S01" > Ultimately, at the end of this gauntlet, there are two possible outcomes.</a><a name="ts_316230_320010_S01" > You either pass the test and get a glimpse of their vulnerability,</a><a name="ts_320010_326770_S01" > or you fail and they retreat further, convinced that they were right all along to keep people at a distance.</a><a name="ts_327050_330370_S01" > It&#x27;s a cycle that is exhausting for both sides.</a><a name="ts_330610_334290_S01" > But it pales in comparison to the next test.</a><a name="ts_335232_337470_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:35]</span> The Phantom X Perfection test.</a><a name="ts_337710_338730_S01" > Meet Linnell.</a><a name="ts_339110_342550_S01" > On August 21st, 2014, she appeared on Oprah,</a><a name="ts_342550_347050_S01" > and shocked the world when she let her ideal man list be known.</a><a name="ts_347470_349370_S01" > There were 43 items.</a><a name="ts_349570_354890_S01" > He had to be African American, with dark complexion, tall, 6 foot 2 or taller.</a><a name="ts_355130_361610_S01" > He had to have an athletic body, 230 pounds, dark eyes, straight white teeth, all 32 of them.</a><a name="ts_361870_365410_S01" > God-fearing, attends service regularly, he needs to be a millionaire,</a><a name="ts_365730_369210_S01" > have a sense of humor, ambitious with drive, and be generous.</a><a name="ts_369210_375310_S01" > I mean, I could literally go on, but the list just literally goes on and on and on.</a><a name="ts_375410_376990_S01" > And there are 43 of these qualities.</a><a name="ts_377270_382630_S01" > Now, if you look at the comments in the Oprah video where this list went viral,</a><a name="ts_382870_385310_S01" > people are lighting Linnell up.</a><a name="ts_385470_389730_S01" > It always amuses me when I meet a woman with a long ideal man list.</a><a name="ts_389910_393530_S01" > Usually, they have the least amount to offer and comes with the most baggage.</a><a name="ts_393730_397590_S01" > Peep, how the first half of that list was all superficial attributes,</a><a name="ts_397590_400890_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:37]</span> hope she found someone the complete opposite to humble her.</a><a name="ts_401350_406490_S01" > God forbid her ideal man ever lost income or worse, got injured, shaking my head.</a><a name="ts_406730_410670_S01" > And remember, fellas, we&#x27;re supposed to be the shallow ones.</a><a name="ts_410890_411850_S01" > Now, here&#x27;s the thing.</a><a name="ts_412030_418230_S01" > That list of Linnells is actually eerily similar to the second test.</a><a name="ts_418490_422730_S01" > All right, I&#x27;m going to give you the secret to understanding all avoidant behavior,</a><a name="ts_422730_424870_S01" > and it is comically simple.</a><a name="ts_424870_430490_S01" > If you ever want to understand why they&#x27;re doing something that seemingly makes no sense</a><a name="ts_430490_434470_S01" > to you, just apply this simple statement to their logic.</a><a name="ts_434990_438410_S01" > Will this allow me to have more independence?</a><a name="ts_438810_444990_S01" > Every avoidant has a Linnell list, except theirs doesn&#x27;t stop at 43 qualities.</a><a name="ts_445370_446490_S01" > It keeps growing.</a><a name="ts_446750_451270_S01" > Anyone who has been an avid watcher of this YouTube channel knows that I talk a lot about</a><a name="ts_451270_454910_S01" > the Phantom X concept in relation to avoidance.</a><a name="ts_455230_461070_S01" > Now, according to Attached, one of the consequences of devaluing your romantic relationship is that</a><a name="ts_461070_466030_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:41]</span> you often wake up long after the relationship has gone stale, having forgotten all those negative</a><a name="ts_466030_470890_S01" > things that annoyed you about your partner, wondering what went wrong and reminiscing longingly</a><a name="ts_470890_472850_S01" > about your long lost love.</a><a name="ts_473010_475430_S01" > We call it the Phantom X phenomenon.</a><a name="ts_475910_480870_S01" > Ultimately, at its core, the Phantom X is a deactivation strategy, something they can</a><a name="ts_480870_482910_S01" > use to keep you at an arm&#x27;s length.</a><a name="ts_483130_488590_S01" > For them, it&#x27;s better to daydream about a long lost love than to commit to the person right</a><a name="ts_488590_489330_S01" > in front of them.</a><a name="ts_489470_492170_S01" > But here&#x27;s where I think many people get it wrong.</a><a name="ts_492370_497970_S01" > Most people assume that an avoidant fixates on one Phantom X, one person that they&#x27;re just</a><a name="ts_497970_500430_S01" > obsessed about, the one that got away.</a><a name="ts_500670_501070_S01" > The truth?</a><a name="ts_501310_503470_S01" > I think it&#x27;s a lot more complicated than that.</a><a name="ts_503470_509170_S01" > Yes, an avoidant might have a predominant Phantom X, someone they seem to romanticize more</a><a name="ts_509170_509690_S01" > than others.</a><a name="ts_509810_511790_S01" > But the reality is, they don&#x27;t just stop there.</a><a name="ts_511930_516890_S01" > They take the best parts from all their past relationships, picking and choosing qualities,</a><a name="ts_517210_521890_S01" > attributes, and experiences that they loved, and fuse them together to create a kind of</a><a name="ts_522490_523950_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:42]</span> Frankenstein Phantom X.</a><a name="ts_524130_526990_S01" > It&#x27;s not just one person that they&#x27;re daydreaming about.</a><a name="ts_527090_532510_S01" > It&#x27;s a composite of all their previous partners stitched together into an impossible standard,</a><a name="ts_532510_534330_S01" > no real person can live up to.</a><a name="ts_534630_538550_S01" > Now, this Frankenstein-like Phantom X is perfect in their eyes.</a><a name="ts_538730_543310_S01" > It meets all of their needs without them having to make themselves vulnerable.</a><a name="ts_543570_548490_S01" > They don&#x27;t have to worry about emotional intimacy or getting too close because in their mind,</a><a name="ts_548990_551150_S01" > the Phantom X literally can&#x27;t hurt them.</a><a name="ts_551290_557230_S01" > The idea of this perfect, unattainable love becomes a protective barrier, something they can</a><a name="ts_557230_561430_S01" > retreat into whenever the real relationship feels too overwhelming or vulnerable.</a><a name="ts_561430_562490_S01" > Now, here&#x27;s the kicker.</a><a name="ts_562610_568450_S01" > No one in the real world can ever measure up to this Frankenstein-like X.</a><a name="ts_568710_574670_S01" > It gives the avoidant an excuse to keep pulling back, keeping you at arm&#x27;s length, all while</a><a name="ts_574670_580256_S01" > continuing to chase a fantasy they&#x27;ve created out of fragments of their past.</a><a name="ts_580928_584300_S01" > Test number three, the global gauntlet repeat.</a><a name="ts_584640_585260_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C"

my avoidant death wheel.</a><a name="ts_590940_595100_S01" > Basically, it&#x27;s a cyclical pattern that all avoidants go through in relationships.</a><a name="ts_595480_602000_S01" > From craving love and connection, to pulling away, to devaluing their partner, eventually</a><a name="ts_602000_604240_S01" > distancing themselves entirely.</a><a name="ts_604900_610000_S01" > It&#x27;s a

video.</a><a name="ts_693370_697830_S01" > They&#x27;ll run you through the gauntlet, testing your emotional endurance by pulling back,</a><a name="ts_698290_700670_S01" > withdrawing affection, and

and over and over again that you can be trusted, that they&#x27;ll finally let you in emotionally.</a><a name="ts_771870_777430_S01" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:51]</span> They need to see

is already worn down by the weight of those endless tests.</a><a name="ts_808070_810950_S01" > And therein lies the issue with avoidance.</a><a name="ts_811150_815070_S01" > There&#x27;s a truth that I think most people are too afraid to tell you.</a><a name="ts_815190_820210_S01" > I think it&#x27;s common, especially in the very early stages of dating, for people who are dating</a><a name="ts_820210_824730_S01" > avoidance to overanalyze or sometimes even justify their behaviors.</a><a name="ts_824730_830470_S01" > They&#x27;ll come up with optimistic interpretations like, this is

name="ts_848320_852750_S01" > When you&#x27;re dating, especially before there&#x27;s any real true commitment, this kind of behavior</a><a name="ts_852750_856750_S01" > is a red flag, not a challenge to overcome.</a><a name="ts_857030_863890_S01" > There&#x27;s a dysfunction in the way people in these scenarios just accept this behavior, thinking,</a><a name="ts_864210_865530_S01" > yep, I&#x27;ve got this.</a><a name="ts_865750_866890_S01" > We&#x27;re different.</a><a name="ts_867170_869870_S01" > They believe they&#x27;re going to be the exception to the rule.</a><a

name="ts_878410_883230_S01" > All these videos out there talking about them fuels these fantasy bonds.</a><a name="ts_883830_888650_S01" > People lean on all these stories of avoidance and

there&#x27;s more room for working through</a><a name="ts_908140_909240_S01" > these testing behaviors.</a><a name="ts_909240_914420_S01" > But in the early stages of dating, accepting them with the belief that they signal something</a><a name="ts_914420_918040_S01" > deeper or unique just sets up people for disappointment.</a><a name="ts_918080_922060_S01" > It&#x27;s a trap that keeps them
