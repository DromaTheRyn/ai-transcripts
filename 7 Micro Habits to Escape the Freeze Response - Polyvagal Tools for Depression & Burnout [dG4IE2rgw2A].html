And we can&#x27;t climb back up the ladder by stressing ourselves out more and more.</a><a name="ts_193700_199500_S00" > So instead, you need to restore your sense of safety and remind yourself that you&#x27;re capable</a><a name="ts_199500_204360_S00" > and that you&#x27;re loved. And this is going to help your nervous system get feeling better.</a><a name="ts_204440_207960_S00" > And I&#x27;m going to teach you some ways to do this on a physiological level.</a><a name="ts_207960_213920_S00" > But when you do, when you restore your sense of safety, that&#x27;s when your nervous system responds by</a><a name="ts_213920_220140_S00" > naturally re-energizing. So you can&#x27;t hate yourself into being happier.</a><a name="ts_220460_221480_S00" > Okay. Here&#x27;s the second key.</a><a name="ts_221640_225500_S00" > When you&#x27;re stuck in depression or the freeze response or the shutdown state, one of the most</a><a name="ts_225500_231480_S00" > common patterns I see is waiting until you feel like it. As in, I don&#x27;t want to go see my friends</a><a name="ts_231480_237040_S00" > until I&#x27;m feeling better. Or I&#x27;m not going to get out of bed until I feel motivated, etc., right?</a><a name="ts_237240_242920_S00" > And so we get stuck in inaction because we want our mood to change first, and then we&#x27;ll take action.</a><a name="ts_242920_247280_S00" > But that is not how the brain works. It&#x27;s not how dopamine, the motivation chemical, works.</a><a name="ts_247980_254780_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:07]</span> Dopamine follows action. Mood follows action. So you take action, and then you get motivated.</a><a name="ts_254980_259220_S00" > You spend time with your friends, and then you feel better. So for these micro habits to work,</a><a name="ts_259300_265640_S00" > you have to start doing tiny things that help you get moving, that help you up-regulate your sense of</a><a name="ts_265640_270220_S00" > safety and movement. So this is the two-pronged approach we&#x27;re going to take. We&#x27;re going to be</a><a name="ts_270220_275820_S00" > restoring your sense of safety while increasing activation, and this is going to help you move</a><a name="ts_275820_282500_S00" > up the polyvagal ladder to be more flexibly able to have better energy, to feel less stressed out,</a><a name="ts_282540_288560_S00" > and to get stuff done. Okay, I know this can feel really hard to do, so let&#x27;s start super tiny. Are</a><a name="ts_288560_294600_S00" > you ready for the seven micro habits? Okay, let&#x27;s go. Here&#x27;s the first one. As you&#x27;re watching this video,</a><a name="ts_295320_305140_S00" > how is your posture? Go ahead and sit a little taller right now. Bring your head up. Roll your</a><a name="ts_305140_312040_S00" > shoulders back a little bit. Just notice how that feels. I don&#x27;t just mean physically. Do you notice</a><a name="ts_312040_322090_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:12]</span> how when you change your posture, you might feel just slightly more confident or a little bit more</a><a name="ts_322090_328530_S00" > energized? A tiny shift in posture can create a ripple effect in how you feel overall. So why is this?</a><a name="ts_328530_335010_S00" > Just getting moving or holding your head up high can send a message to your nervous system that you</a><a name="ts_335010_342290_S00" > are capable of handling, even if it&#x27;s just this moment. So if you&#x27;re lying in bed right now, sit up in bed</a><a name="ts_342290_349130_S00" > instead. Getting upright and holding your head up helps your nervous system activate. Instead of looking</a><a name="ts_349130_358450_S00" > down, raise your eyes. Look around the room, okay? Put your feet on the floor. Stand upright if you feel like</a><a name="ts_358450_364810_S00" > it. Anything that helps you get more vertical sends a message from your body up to your brain to feel</a><a name="ts_364810_371390_S00" > safer. It sends a message that I am more competent, that I&#x27;m capable. Okay, so that&#x27;s the first micro</a><a name="ts_371390_379860_S00" > habit. Just have a more erect posture. This first micro habit was activating. The next one is going to be</a><a name="ts_379860_386820_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:06:19]</span> both restoring safety and helping you get activated, and that is getting morning light. The light that enters</a><a name="ts_386820_391940_S00" > our eyes sends a message to our brain about how much energy to have. Our primal ancestors knew</a><a name="ts_391940_397460_S00" > that a bright sunny day was a great day to go out and chase some woolly mammoths, and a cold rainy day</a><a name="ts_397460_404880_S00" > was a good day to stay in the cave and conserve energy. So light exposure actually changes your brain.</a><a name="ts_405000_410320_S00" > Light exposure is one of the simplest and most scientifically proven ways to improve mood, energy, focus, and sleep.</a><a name="ts_410320_415700_S00" > When your eyes take in light, your brain releases energizing neurotransmitters, so you can go</a><a name="ts_415700_422500_S00" > run after that mammoth, right? Research shows that light exposure can improve metabolic health, lower blood</a><a name="ts_422500_429248_S00" > pressure, and support immune function. And guess what? All of this helps regulate emotions. So how do you do it?</a><a name="ts_429920_435560_S00" > Best way to do this is to try to get 10 to 20 minutes of natural sunlight within the first hour of waking</a><a name="ts_435560_442120_S00" > up. This is best outside without sunglasses. Don&#x27;t stare at the sun. If it&#x27;s cloudy, stay in a little</a><a name="ts_442120_447160_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:07:22]</span> bit longer. Diffuse daylight still counts, okay? That&#x27;s your best option. Go outside in the morning,</a><a name="ts_447320_454780_S00" > sit on your porch, drink a cup of hot cocoa, whatever it is that you do, okay? That&#x27;s great. It&#x27;s good for</a><a name="ts_454780_460400_S00" > your mood, and it&#x27;s good to help you both get activated and restore your sense of safety. Hopefully that&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_460400_464720_S00" > possible for you. There&#x27;s a few other ways we can get more light in our eyes as well. Open your blinds in</a><a name="ts_464720_470560_S00" > your home and turn on more lights. That natural light coming from outside and the artificial lights</a><a name="ts_470560_476770_S00" > can both be helpful. And if you live in somewhere that&#x27;s dark a lot of the time, or it&#x27;s winter,</a><a name="ts_476970_482990_S00" > or if you&#x27;re experiencing depression even in the summer, you could consider a 10,000 lux light therapy</a><a name="ts_482990_487890_S00" > lamp. There&#x27;s been some large high-quality studies that have shown that light therapy is one of the most</a><a name="ts_487890_494190_S00" > powerful antidepressants. So getting plenty of light exposure helps prime your brain to be more active</a><a name="ts_494190_500260_S00" > and to feel more safe. Okay, on to number three. Use heat and cold. Temperature can wake up your system</a><a name="ts_500260_506740_S00" > and get you unstuck from the freeze response down here. Sip a warm drink. Holding a warm cup, noticing</a><a name="ts_506740_513952_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:08:26]</span> the sensation, and taking one slow sip can give your body a cue of comfort and help you be more present.</a><a name="ts_514816_520530_S00" > Or if you&#x27;d like something a bit more activating, you could try washing your face in cold water. Or with</a><a name="ts_520530_525690_S00" > doctor supervision, you could consider cold plunges. The cold water triggers a bunch of positive effects</a><a name="ts_525690_531270_S00" > from slowing your heart rate to expanding your window of tolerance. Now if the idea of a cold</a><a name="ts_531270_534950_S00" > plunge seems like a bit much, you could try experimenting with temperature in the shower.</a><a name="ts_535150_540470_S00" > You could take a hot shower and just notice how the water feels on your skin, or gradually switch the</a><a name="ts_540470_546070_S00" > temperature up and down and watch your body get more alert and activated. So heat and cold can help your</a><a name="ts_546070_551490_S00" > nervous system get unstuck from freeze. And you know, one of the things I want to mention is it&#x27;s not</a><a name="ts_551490_557030_S00" > always the case, but it&#x27;s often the case that to go from dorsal vagal to shut down response to safe and</a><a name="ts_557030_562750_S00" > connected, we have to go through activation. So that&#x27;s one of the reasons why temperature changes can do</a><a name="ts_562750_568030_S00" > that. Okay, number four. Let&#x27;s trigger the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve has a lot to do with the connection</a><a name="ts_568030_573150_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:09:28]</span> between mind and body. When it&#x27;s activated, it can help your nervous system calm down. So here&#x27;s two easy ways</a><a name="ts_573150_580670_S00" > to do that. First one, to hum or sigh. Your vagus nerve loves vibration. Humming, singing a little tune,</a><a name="ts_581310_588530_S00" > or even letting out a long sigh stimulates that vagus nerve, which can help you regulate without</a><a name="ts_588530_596000_S00" > needing a lot of energy to do so. So you could try letting out the foghorn breath, a la Peter Levine.</a><a name="ts_596000_603310_S00" > (.......)</a><a name="ts_603310_612100_S00" > just like that, or just a long sigh. Or you could just hum. Next one is massaging your face. Your vagus</a><a name="ts_612100_619600_S00" > nerve actually runs all through your face. You can gently stimulate it by massaging your face. You can</a><a name="ts_619600_630620_S00" > tap right under your eyes, gently massage it. You can stroke your cheeks or tap them. You can stroke your</a><a name="ts_630620_636660_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:10:30]</span> forehead. And you might not realize this, but when people are stressed, they naturally do this. Like,</a><a name="ts_636660_642160_S00" > Messi, when he&#x27;s stressed, he&#x27;s always rubbing his forehead like this. And one of the reasons we do</a><a name="ts_642160_648080_S00" > this is the vagus nerve stimulation sends messages to your nervous system that here in this moment,</a><a name="ts_648120_652480_S00" > I&#x27;m safe enough. Okay, and if you&#x27;d like to learn more ways to calm your nervous system and turn on</a><a name="ts_652480_657420_S00" > that parasympathetic response, you can check out my How to Process Trauma online course. It&#x27;s included</a><a name="ts_657420_662600_S00" > as part of the Therapy to Nutshell membership. I&#x27;ll link that below. Okay, number five. For many people,</a><a name="ts_662600_667440_S00" > the worst time of their day is the morning. For other people, it&#x27;s later in the day. What&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_667440_672920_S00" > important is that you structure the worst time of your day. Like, you might feel so overwhelmed or</a><a name="ts_672920_677500_S00" > frozen in the morning that you can&#x27;t get out of bed or get yourself going. So during this time,</a><a name="ts_677500_682240_S00" > you&#x27;ll most likely benefit from some structure to get through it. Let me give you an example. My friend</a><a name="ts_682240_686980_S00" > Rachel struggled with paralyzing anxiety in the mornings, and she had a super hard time getting out of bed.</a><a name="ts_686980_693380_S00" > So she arranged to have her mom call her every morning at 9am, and her goal was to be out of bed</a><a name="ts_693380_698680_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:11:33]</span> and sitting up in a chair when her mom called. And this structure helped her get moving when she was</a><a name="ts_698680_704900_S00" > really just drowning in anxiety. She also got a dog, and the dog helps her get outside and on a walk each</a><a name="ts_704900_709980_S00" > morning. And she said that&#x27;s been one of the most helpful things for her to break the cycle of being</a><a name="ts_709980_716000_S00" > stuck in bed. So how can you set structure around your worst times? I&#x27;ll give you a few examples. Pick one</a><a name="ts_716000_721340_S00" > thing you always do when you wake up that does not require a decision, and then do it. So this might</a><a name="ts_721340_725960_S00" > be something like drinking a glass of water on your nightstand or just sitting up and opening your</a><a name="ts_725960_731360_S00" > blinds. You can make this easier by making the decision the night before. So lay your clothes out</a><a name="ts_731360_736680_S00" > or have the same breakfast ready every morning, like overnight oats or something, or just keeping your</a><a name="ts_736680_742220_S00" > meds or a toothbrush right where you&#x27;ll see it first thing in the morning. Long story short is what we&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_742220_746260_S00" > trying to do is make it easier for you to get moving. We&#x27;re going to try and remove those</a><a name="ts_746260_750340_S00" > obstacles. So this might look like keeping a robe or a hoodie right next to your bed so you&#x27;re warm</a><a name="ts_750340_755940_S00" > when you stand up. Or moving your alarm across the room and setting it to play like upbeat music or a</a><a name="ts_755940_761240_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:12:35]</span> funny podcast in the morning. Anything that&#x27;s kind of activating and helps you overcome this dread of</a><a name="ts_761240_766280_S00" > overwhelm is going to help you. So you&#x27;ve got to build some structure around the hardest time of your</a><a name="ts_766280_771180_S00" > day. Maybe it&#x27;s nighttime. Like whatever time it is, plan something small to help you get through that</a><a name="ts_771180_775740_S00" > time. Even if it&#x27;s just like a reminder on your phone that you are loved, right? Like that&#x27;s an</a><a name="ts_775740_779960_S00" > example of structure. So think of a way to add structure to the worst part of your day. Okay,</a><a name="ts_780040_784920_S00" > number six, you&#x27;ve got to combat your negativity filter. You&#x27;ve got to restore balance to the force.</a><a name="ts_785080_790900_S00" > So depression drains your energy and it constantly tells you like, why bother? Everything&#x27;s pointless.</a><a name="ts_791240_796620_S00" > There&#x27;s no point in trying. And when we&#x27;re constantly exposed to like stressful thoughts</a><a name="ts_796620_802720_S00" > or worrisome messaging, it sends a message to our nervous system that the best option is to just</a><a name="ts_802720_807520_S00" > shut down and conserve energy. And that&#x27;s where we get stuck in this freeze or shutdown response.</a><a name="ts_807680_813080_S00" > So if we want to restore a sense of safety and agency, we need to actively combat our negativity</a><a name="ts_813080_818600_S00" > bias and look for good. And here&#x27;s a few ways to do that. Limit negative stimuli like the news,</a><a name="ts_819080_824840_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:13:39]</span> negative people, even opening your email or looking around your messy house. I know we can&#x27;t avoid this</a><a name="ts_824840_831320_S00" > forever, but just for now we&#x27;re going to filter out those negative stimuli. So close up the door to a</a><a name="ts_831320_837680_S00" > messy room, cover your sink with a towel. Disorganization and negative inputs can feel really overwhelming,</a><a name="ts_837680_842300_S00" > which is why we&#x27;re going to address them, but we&#x27;re just going to do it one at a time. And then</a><a name="ts_842300_847480_S00" > intentionally seek out stuff that brings you good energy. It might be a group chat where you share funny</a><a name="ts_847480_853960_S00" > memes with your siblings, or you could follow good news channels like that good news girl. Or like this is</a><a name="ts_853960_857660_S00" > literally one of the best things you can do is simple gratitude practice. When you write down</a><a name="ts_857660_863160_S00" > three things you&#x27;re grateful for every day, it helps your nervous system get the message that</a><a name="ts_863160_870340_S00" > maybe life is not so awful that I just need to hide in my cave. My old boss, Monica, she was amazing. And</a><a name="ts_870340_874820_S00" > with her clients who were struggling, she would ask them to sit out on their porch and send her a picture</a><a name="ts_874820_880920_S00" > of one good thing every day. So you could try sending a photo to someone every morning. Lastly, I would say</a><a name="ts_880920_884780_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:14:40]</span> one of the things that can truly bring the most happiness is to find someone to help.</a><a name="ts_885000_889840_S00" > Look for a little way to take action that adds just a little bit of love or joy to the world.</a><a name="ts_889980_895120_S00" > So that might be like just saying hi to someone on the street or petting the neighbor&#x27;s dog or sending</a><a name="ts_895120_899920_S00" > an I love you text. I would walk down the sidewalk and I would sometimes just pull a few weeds or pick</a><a name="ts_899920_904820_S00" > up a piece of trash and put it in the trash. Like that would make my day just like incrementally better.</a><a name="ts_904820_910260_S00" > And noticing the good or being the good in the world helps restore your sense of safety</a><a name="ts_910260_915980_S00" > and can move you up the ladder. Okay, last one, number seven. One of the biggest problems with</a><a name="ts_915980_923240_S00" > modern life is that most of us are so dang busy all the time. Busyness keeps us stuck in high alert and</a><a name="ts_923240_928920_S00" > stuck in this sympathetic state. And then this can be exhausting, which can trigger that dorsal bagel state.</a><a name="ts_928920_935900_S00" > In order to restore our energy and sense of safety, we need to create a sustainable approach to work</a><a name="ts_935900_942580_S00" > and rest. So you&#x27;ve got to schedule in time to heal and restore. So while getting out of the free state</a><a name="ts_942580_948440_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:15:42]</span> does involve activating, if your only way to manage life is to always be busy and stressed out, you are</a><a name="ts_948440_955600_S00" > going to burn out and you&#x27;ll get stuck here. So you&#x27;ve got to schedule in time to rest and heal. So true rest</a><a name="ts_955600_960980_S00" > looks different for everyone. For me, it&#x27;s like hiking or tinkering in my garage. Those literally</a><a name="ts_960980_967600_S00" > give me more energy. For others, it&#x27;s taking a nap or coloring. You&#x27;ve got to find what fills your soul.</a><a name="ts_967760_971660_S00" > And again, it&#x27;s not stress here that&#x27;s the problem. Stress is actually good for you. It&#x27;s good to spend</a><a name="ts_971660_976280_S00" > moments in these states. It&#x27;s good to be stressed out occasionally. No problem. The problem is chronic</a><a name="ts_976280_983480_S00" > stress. So being stressed out all the time wears out your nervous system. So it&#x27;s really important that you</a><a name="ts_983480_990880_S00" > have a clear line between on and off times for work and rest. That might look like having a ritual</a><a name="ts_990880_995840_S00" > to disconnect when you go home from work or taking email off your phone or turning off notifications.</a><a name="ts_996000_1002280_S00" > And I would just say, like, again, you want to identify real rest, not just distraction. True rest</a><a name="ts_1002280_1008120_S00" > helps your nervous system recharge and restore. And screen time often just distracts you while keeping</a><a name="ts_1008120_1012880_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:16:48]</span> your nervous system stressed. So I truly think one of the reasons people feel so burnt out and tired and</a><a name="ts_1012880_1016620_S00" > stressed and exhausted is because they think they&#x27;re resting when they&#x27;re just kind of</a><a name="ts_1016620_1020600_S00" > putting their nervous system like in their backpack, like there&#x27;s stress in their backpack,</a><a name="ts_1021200_1026040_S00" > and they&#x27;re just like carrying it around like metaphorically while watching a show. It&#x27;s usually</a><a name="ts_1026040_1031340_S00" > not true rest. Practicing mindfulness can help you expand your capacity to rest. Again, this is a hard</a><a name="ts_1031340_1037800_S00" > one for me, but learning to slow down is a really valuable way to teach your nervous system that you&#x27;re safe.</a><a name="ts_1037800_1042900_S00" > And on that note, multitasking is your enemy. Just look it up, right? Doing one thing at a time</a><a name="ts_1042900_1048240_S00" > can be very soothing. Okay, maybe I&#x27;m getting carried away with all the advice, but I have a bonus tip for</a><a name="ts_1048240_1053480_S00" > you. Scents are a super pleasant way to get activated. Orange zest, aromatherapy oils, or even a strong</a><a name="ts_1053480_1060180_S00" > peppermint can help your senses wake up and help you get like that initial boost to your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_1060360_1066120_S00" > Okay, so there you have it. Seven micro habits to help you get unstuck from freeze or the dorsal vagal state.</a><a name="ts_1066120_1071060_S00" > And if you&#x27;d like to give the gift of calm to someone you care about, you could send them a</a><a name="ts_1071060_1076600_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:17:51]</span> link to my free grounding skills course. They don&#x27;t have to sign up for anything that costs money,</a><a name="ts_1076600_1084480_S00" > and it gives you access to 15 simple lessons to soothe stress, PTSD, and anxiety in the body. So</a><a name="ts_1084480_1089920_S00" > I&#x27;ll definitely put that link in the description. And if you have any other micro habits that pull you out</a><a name="ts_1089920_1095780_S00" > of feeling depressed, I&#x27;d love to see you share those in the comments as well. Whatever works to pull you</a><a name="ts_1095780_1100992_S00" > up the ladder and out of that dorsal vagal shutdown. I would love to hear what works for you. Okay,</a><a name="ts_1100992_1102010_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1102010_1105696_S00" > thank you for being a positive online community for each other, and please take care.</a></p></div></body>
