name="ts_3150_4430_S00" > I&#x27;m gonna get in shape.</a><a name="ts_4650_6330_S00" > I&#x27;m gonna stop yelling at my kids.</a><a name="ts_6750_9110_S00" > This is the week I start to be happier.</a><a name="ts_9350_10310_S00" > If you&#x27;ve ever said,</a><a name="ts_10450_12350_S00" > I&#x27;m gonna change my whole life on Monday,</a><a name="ts_12470_14570_S00" > and then Monday comes and you&#x27;re exhausted</a><a name="ts_14570_15910_S00" > and your kids are melting down,</a><a name="ts_16290_17390_S00" > you know what I&#x27;m talking about.</a><a name="ts_17630_20010_S00" > You give up, and that fire in your belly</a><a name="ts_20010_22530_S00" > gets extinguished by a bowl of Captain Crunch.</a><a name="ts_23010_24290_S00" > But don&#x27;t pull out the cereal yet,</a><a name="ts_24370_26250_S00" > because I&#x27;m gonna share the system I use</a><a name="ts_26250_29230_S00" > to create lasting change for myself and my clients.</a><a name="ts_29230_31330_S00" > It won&#x27;t fix everything by Monday,</a><a name="ts_31590_33950_S00" > but it will actually work over the long run,</a><a name="ts_34030_35650_S00" > and eventually you&#x27;ll be at a place</a><a name="ts_35650_36950_S00" > in the not-too-distant future</a><a name="ts_36950_40608_S00" > where you can feel really good about who you&#x27;ve become.</a><a name="ts_40608_48608_S00" > (........)</a><a name="ts_48608_51070_S00" > Let&#x27;s look at a goal, like, I&#x27;m gonna be happier.</a><a name="ts_51530_52890_S00" > Seems simple enough, right?</a><a name="ts_53050_55690_S00" > It&#x27;s like one marble, small, manageable.</a><a name="ts_56030_58010_S00" > You think, yeah, I can just carry that around.</a><a name="ts_58310_60192_S00" > Just remember to be happy.</a><a name="ts_60832_61810_S00" > But let&#x27;s look closer.</a><a name="ts_61970_64790_S00" > Even a single goal, like, I&#x27;m gonna be happier,</a><a name="ts_65290_67070_S00" > or I&#x27;m gonna stop yelling at my kids,</a><a name="ts_67070_69030_S00" > is actually a massive change,</a><a name="ts_69070_72530_S00" > because it requires me to respond differently</a><a name="ts_72530_75010_S00" > to hundreds of situations a day</a><a name="ts_75010_77010_S00" > that I don&#x27;t have a new habit for.</a><a name="ts_77230_79310_S00" > I can think of a few dozen skills,</a><a name="ts_79510_80810_S00" > from, like, handling disappointment,</a><a name="ts_80810_82730_S00" > to letting go of a victim mindset,</a><a name="ts_82970_85370_S00" > to noticing the positive, and being grateful,</a><a name="ts_85450_87770_S00" > and having purpose in my life, and dealing with anger.</a><a name="ts_88030_90150_S00" > So now I&#x27;ve gotta hang on to happiness</a><a name="ts_90150_91570_S00" > in all of these situations,</a><a name="ts_91570_94710_S00" > and it&#x27;s starting to feel a little bit desperate,</a><a name="ts_94710_96800_S00" > but maybe I can pull it off.</a><a name="ts_97536_98970_S00" > But now, let&#x27;s take a closer look.</a><a name="ts_99150_100770_S00" > Let&#x27;s take just one of those skills,</a><a name="ts_101090_103670_S00" > like, replacing a victim mentality</a><a name="ts_103670_106170_S00" > with a sense of personal agency.</a><a name="ts_106550_108350_S00" > This is something that can make me happier.</a><a name="ts_108530_110650_S00" > On paper, that feels like one thing.</a><a name="ts_110850_114090_S00" > But in reality, it&#x27;s a whole handful of responses</a><a name="ts_114090_115930_S00" > to dozens of situations,</a><a name="ts_116130_117690_S00" > like, dealing with a rude customer,</a><a name="ts_118090_121090_S00" > managing my commute, or balancing my budget.</a><a name="ts_121090_124470_S00" > And it requires a few dozen skills,</a><a name="ts_124470_126570_S00" > from rewriting trauma stories,</a><a name="ts_126790_128350_S00" > to practicing healthy boundaries.</a><a name="ts_128710_132810_S00" > So if your be happier goal includes 10 areas of change,</a><a name="ts_133050_136290_S00" > and each of those areas has 10 plus habits,</a><a name="ts_137030_140830_S00" > pretty soon you&#x27;re trying to juggle 100 to 150 marbles.</a><a name="ts_141010_143520_S00" > These are new behaviors you don&#x27;t have yet.</a><a name="ts_143520_145312_S00" > (..)</a><a name="ts_145312_148160_S00" > And what happens when you try to hold 100 marbles in your hands?</a><a name="ts_148160_149820_S00" > We all lose our marbles.</a><a name="ts_150000_152400_S00" > It can feel impossible to change.</a><a name="ts_152620_153760_S00" > Not because you&#x27;re lazy.</a><a name="ts_154040_155180_S00" > Not because you&#x27;re weak.</a><a name="ts_155400_158780_S00" > Humans simply can&#x27;t make that many changes at once.</a><a name="ts_158960_160400_S00" > You don&#x27;t need to try harder.</a><a name="ts_160540_163904_S00" > You need a system that can hold change over time.</a><a name="ts_163904_166496_S00" > (...)</a><a name="ts_166496_168790_S00" > Real and lasting change truly happens</a><a name="ts_168790_173410_S00" > when you build a system to implement tiny changes.</a><a name="ts_173410_175550_S00" > It is way more effective than a resolution.</a><a name="ts_175770_176930_S00" > So here&#x27;s how you do it.</a><a name="ts_176930_181630_S00" > The key is to pick only one to two tiny changes to make per month.</a><a name="ts_181850_182890_S00" > I&#x27;m serious about this.</a><a name="ts_182990_183650_S00" > Jim Collins said,</a><a name="ts_183770_186850_S00" > If you have more than three priorities, you have none.</a><a name="ts_187270_191030_S00" > Your main priority is one to two tiny habits.</a><a name="ts_191110_192930_S00" > This is what you can hold and carry around with you,</a><a name="ts_192990_194250_S00" > and try to remember to do all the time.</a><a name="ts_194450_198490_S00" > And your third priority is simply maintaining your real-life responsibilities,</a><a name="ts_198670_200110_S00" > like work, family, and sleep.</a><a name="ts_200330_201850_S00" > So here&#x27;s why tiny works.</a><a name="ts_202210_203150_S00" > It feels safe.</a><a name="ts_203250_204750_S00" > Your nervous system won&#x27;t sabotage you.</a><a name="ts_204750_207950_S00" > It builds confidence, like, oh, hey, I did that.</a><a name="ts_208050_208990_S00" > That feels good.</a><a name="ts_208990_210850_S00" > And it gives your brain repetition,</a><a name="ts_210850_213370_S00" > which is the ingredient of lasting habits.</a><a name="ts_213370_214432_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_214432_216840_S00" > One little repetition doesn&#x27;t change much at first,</a><a name="ts_216980_219820_S00" > but repeated daily, something powerful begins to shift.</a><a name="ts_220060_223920_S00" > This is exactly how the British cycling team went from embarrassing to elite.</a><a name="ts_224080_226040_S00" > This is my favorite story from Atomic Habits.</a><a name="ts_226240_230580_S00" > For decades, they tried pushing harder, harder training, harder goals,</a><a name="ts_230660_232120_S00" > and nothing changed.</a><a name="ts_232120_237600_S00" > Then they hired coach Dave Brailsford, who focused on 1% improvements.</a><a name="ts_237880_242000_S00" > Better bike seats, improved hand washing so they didn&#x27;t get sick as often,</a><a name="ts_242620_247660_S00" > optimized sleep, white paint inside the bike van so they could spot dust or missing parts,</a><a name="ts_248060_249320_S00" > and better nutrition.</a><a name="ts_250144_254656_S00" > Each change alone was almost imperceptible, but when they added up,</a><a name="ts_255296_258830_S00" > within a few years, they dominated the Tour de France and then the Olympics.</a><a name="ts_259616_262830_S00" > Tiny change isn&#x27;t sexy, but it&#x27;s what actually works.</a><a name="ts_262830_266750_S00" > So, for example, Ryan and I have a goal to make our home happier.</a><a name="ts_267090_268550_S00" > What are we actually doing?</a><a name="ts_268950_271904_S00" > This month, Ryan is treating his acid reflux,</a><a name="ts_272736_276608_S00" > and I have a reminder on my phone to wrestle with the kids every night.</a><a name="ts_277248_280560_S00" > If you want to improve your mental health, which is a big, complicated goal,</a><a name="ts_280800_286848_S00" > here&#x27;s some examples of tiny habits that will add up if you do just one of them over and over again for a month.</a><a name="ts_287552_290816_S00" > Do a checkup with your doctor and start taking a multivitamin daily.</a><a name="ts_291424_293792_S00" > Do light therapy for ten minutes every morning.</a><a name="ts_294432_298170_S00" > Watch one video from the emotion processing course per day for a month.</a><a name="ts_298310_300750_S00" > It&#x27;s part of our membership. You can learn more about that below.</a><a name="ts_301210_303456_S00" > You could go for a two-minute walk each day.</a><a name="ts_304096_307104_S00" > You could practice gratitude three minutes a day.</a><a name="ts_307904_309710_S00" > These tiny habits create momentum.</a><a name="ts_309710_313030_S00" > They add up over time, and they can truly create a massive change.</a><a name="ts_313530_316450_S00" > Okay, so how do you build a system to achieve your goals?</a><a name="ts_316450_318850_S00" > The first step is, we just talked about, make it tiny.</a><a name="ts_319090_323610_S00" > You need a specific, concrete behavior that you&#x27;re gonna do, not something you&#x27;re not gonna do.</a><a name="ts_323630_324590_S00" > So, a positive goal.</a><a name="ts_324810_327310_S00" > And then, the second thing is, make it easy.</a><a name="ts_327870_331430_S00" > Environment shapes your behavior far more than willpower does.</a><a name="ts_331590_333810_S00" > So, like, this jar is like an environment. It&#x27;s your system.</a><a name="ts_334290_338590_S00" > You want to make bad habits hard and good habits easier.</a><a name="ts_338590_345830_S00" > So, for example, if you want to decrease your screen time, you&#x27;ve got to delete Instagram off your phone and use it on your computer.</a><a name="ts_346030_350690_S00" > Or you&#x27;ve got to add an annoying time blocker app to your phone that makes it harder to use Instagram.</a><a name="ts_351110_358430_S00" > The Atomic Habits guy had his assistant change his social media passwords each week, and she wouldn&#x27;t tell him the password until Friday.</a><a name="ts_358650_362250_S00" > So, we make good things easier, bad things harder.</a><a name="ts_362250_366310_S00" > Okay, you want to stop feeling like a victim, right? This is toward our happiness goal.</a><a name="ts_366690_371870_S00" > Write down the most common things you say in a victim mindset, and write down what you&#x27;d replace them with,</a><a name="ts_371970_377530_S00" > and then ask your therapist or partner or coworkers or friends to point it out every time you say them.</a><a name="ts_377910_382910_S00" > You&#x27;re making it hard to do the wrong thing, and you make it easier to do the new habit.</a><a name="ts_383310_388130_S00" > This is not about moral strength. It&#x27;s not trying to hold all your marbles in your hand by being stronger.</a><a name="ts_388810_391950_S00" > Let me give you another example. Trying to eat better is white-knuckling, right?</a><a name="ts_392410_398430_S00" > Building a meal plan and setting up recurring grocery deliveries is a system that you don&#x27;t have to think about.</a><a name="ts_398990_404000_S00" > Systems are about shaping an environment that nudges you toward the person you want to become.</a><a name="ts_404640_408830_S00" > Okay, number three is stack it. Pair your new habit with a task you already do.</a><a name="ts_408990_412270_S00" > I used to lose my keys, like, three times a day. It drove Ryan crazy.</a><a name="ts_412450_417190_S00" > So, he put a hook by the door for me. Now, I walk through the door and I put my keys on the hook.</a><a name="ts_417590_421570_S00" > And now I only lose my keys, like, once a week. So, that&#x27;s progress.</a><a name="ts_421570_426750_S00" > Okay, habit stacking looks like after closing your laptop, you stretch for one minute.</a><a name="ts_426950_428950_S00" > I take my meds when I brush my teeth.</a><a name="ts_429150_431584_S00" > I do my Duolingo when I...</a><a name="ts_431584_432864_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_432864_437430_S00" > In our happiness goal, one habit you could stack is when you walk through a doorway,</a><a name="ts_437710_439936_S00" > say, I am the master of my fate.</a><a name="ts_440544_444250_S00" > Or when you floss your teeth at night, look in the mirror and say, three wins that you had that day.</a><a name="ts_444250_449030_S00" > Okay, here&#x27;s your fourth habit or your fourth part of your system. Make it visual.</a><a name="ts_449230_451190_S00" > Put your goal in front of your eyes.</a><a name="ts_451310_454810_S00" > If you have to remember to look up what your habit is, that&#x27;s an extra barrier.</a><a name="ts_455090_459550_S00" > So, if you want to play guitar more, stick your guitar in your living room where you&#x27;ll see it.</a><a name="ts_459830_462830_S00" > Want to make it even easier?
