going to be talking about how to restore your sense of safety when you&#x27;ve</a><a name="ts_4950_7510_" > experienced trauma or chronic stress.</a><a name="ts_7930_13510_" > And I am just so excited to have such an amazing guest today.</a><a name="ts_13750_14910_" > It&#x27;s Dr. Arielle Schwartz.</a><a name="ts_15050_17470_" > She has, like, written a book.</a><a name="ts_17610_23610_" > She&#x27;s written eight of the books on this topic, and she has so much depth of knowledge as far</a><a name="ts_23610_28910_" > as somatic approaches to healing trauma, polyvagal approaches, EMDR.</a><a name="ts_28910_31190_" > She also teaches trauma-informed yoga.</a><a name="ts_31390_36550_" > She&#x27;s also written a book, The Polyvagal Theory Workbook for Trauma, and I&#x27;ve gone through</a><a name="ts_36550_36690_" > it.</a><a name="ts_36790_37930_" > It&#x27;s great stuff.</a><a name="ts_38190_42970_" > So today we&#x27;re going to be talking about how trauma shows up in the body, how to restore</a><a name="ts_42970_43830_" > your sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_43950_49670_" > We do two exercises together where I get to release a little bit of trauma from my body.</a><a name="ts_50070_55510_" > And we talk about, is healing from CPTSD really possible, like, actually?</a><a name="ts_56448_58368_" > And I think you&#x27;ll be really happy to hear the answer.</a><a name="ts_59296_59872_" > Let&#x27;s jump in.</a><a name="ts_59872_68576_" > (.........)</a><a name="ts_68576_70770_" > Well, thank you so much for being here today.</a><a name="ts_70990_73490_" > Really appreciate you taking the time out of your schedule to join us.</a><a name="ts_73750_74170_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_74490_76630_" > As I mentioned, I&#x27;ve really been looking forward to this.</a><a name="ts_76830_78110_" > I admire you.</a><a name="ts_78270_80550_" > I admire the information you put out there.</a><a name="ts_80770_83210_" > I recommend it to lots of folks to listen to you.</a><a name="ts_83430_83450_" > Wow.</a><a name="ts_83450_86010_" > And so it&#x27;s exciting to be part of your work.</a><a name="ts_86430_87590_" > Oh, thank you so much.</a><a name="ts_87730_89050_" > That is, like, the highest praise.</a><a name="ts_89270_90370_" > So I really appreciate that.</a><a name="ts_90370_91712_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_91712_92310_" > Oh, okay.</a><a name="ts_92310_97750_" > So today we&#x27;re going to be talking about how to restore a sense of safety after trauma.</a><a name="ts_97750_103910_" > And I was wondering if maybe we should start, would you be willing to do a quick overview</a><a name="ts_103910_106910_" > of polyvagal theory and how that works?</a><a name="ts_107430_113410_" > For the audience, she&#x27;s written her eighth book, which is the polyvagal theory workbook.</a><a name="ts_113410_115990_" > And I&#x27;ve just been working through it and I&#x27;m like, this is good stuff.</a><a name="ts_115990_118016_" > So I&#x27;d love to hear your perspective.</a><a name="ts_118720_118016_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_118970_119830_" > I&#x27;m happy to.</a><a name="ts_119950_121890_" > I&#x27;m going to give you polyvagal theory in a nutshell.</a><a name="ts_122150_122570_" > How&#x27;s that?</a><a name="ts_122910_123170_" > Perfect.</a><a name="ts_123330_123730_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_123730_125010_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_125010_132350_" > So there are some key elements that I think really help us understand what is polyvagal theory.</a><a name="ts_132630_138890_" > Probably the first thing that I&#x27;ll name is that if we think about the name polyvagal, poly refers</a><a name="ts_138890_139670_" > to multiple.</a><a name="ts_139930_142110_" > Vagal is referring to the vagus nerve.</a><a name="ts_142830_144970_" > Vagus nerve is our 10th cranial nerve.</a><a name="ts_144970_150890_" > It&#x27;s a mind-body superhighway of connection and this idea that we have multiple circuits</a><a name="ts_150890_158090_" > of the vagus nerve basically means that we have kind of from an evolutionary standpoint,</a><a name="ts_158090_164090_" > one of those circuits is very much about social connection and sensing safety.</a><a name="ts_164090_165216_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_165216_172050_" > We also have a circuit of the vagus nerve that is very much connected to the lower body,</a><a name="ts_172050_177850_" > our digestive organs, our reproductive organs, and it&#x27;s often associated with the parasympathetic</a><a name="ts_177850_182390_" > nervous system or our capacity to go into a rest and digest state.</a><a name="ts_182390_183490_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_183490_187250_" > So why do we have multiple circuits of the vagus nerve?</a><a name="ts_187610_193490_" > It&#x27;s maybe the kind of short answer to that is that if we think about going into stillness</a><a name="ts_193490_199930_" > as mammals, and I&#x27;ll kind of broaden this out beyond humans, in order to rest in stillness,</a><a name="ts_199930_204310_" > we need to know that it&#x27;s safe enough, that there&#x27;s not a predator out there, that there</a><a name="ts_204310_211510_" > is not some danger lurking, and so we utilize this upper vagal circuit and where that travels</a><a name="ts_211510_220190_" > into this, the kind of fibers of the vagus nerve go into our sense organs, our eyes, our ears,</a><a name="ts_220190_225910_" > as well as our ability to call out or express through our voice.</a><a name="ts_226130_228750_" > And so we&#x27;re going to track our environment.</a><a name="ts_228750_229790_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_229790_234550_" > Are there cues of safety or are there cues of threat or is there something super dangerous</a><a name="ts_234550_235360_" > out there?</a><a name="ts_236160_242490_" > We&#x27;re going to listen with our ears for cues of safety, cues of threat, cues of danger.</a><a name="ts_242490_251090_" > And depending on whether we&#x27;re receiving those cues of safety or threat, basically our vagus</a><a name="ts_251090_257810_" > nerve helps our nervous system and our body respond to that without us even having to think</a><a name="ts_257810_258270_" > about it.</a><a name="ts_258790_259030_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_259630_267010_" > So what would be a cue of safety, right, that allows us to rest that allows us to</a><a name="ts_267010_273450_" > go into stillness, a cue of safety might come from the loving gaze of another person.</a><a name="ts_273450_274110_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_274110_281950_" > Where we really receive that kind smile, the body language, the facial expressions.</a><a name="ts_282880_290350_" > Another cue of safety that we might receive is the voice tone that comes in through our ears</a><a name="ts_290350_296950_" > that is basically letting you know through soothing tones, I&#x27;m right here, I&#x27;ve got you.</a><a name="ts_297650_297930_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_297930_306030_" > And if we think about an infant that is totally dependent upon our caregivers, an infant is</a><a name="ts_306030_313250_" > going to rely on those cues that lets the infant know it&#x27;s safe to rest in the arms of my caretaker,</a><a name="ts_313430_316410_" > because essentially they&#x27;re going to protect me.</a><a name="ts_316570_320650_" > They&#x27;re going to know whether there&#x27;s dangers out there.</a><a name="ts_320650_321664_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_321664_326250_" > They&#x27;re going to give me the cues that let me know it&#x27;s safe enough and therefore I can</a><a name="ts_326250_332750_" > rest into stillness in closeness to that person that&#x27;s going to protect me.</a><a name="ts_333490_333630_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_333630_333790_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_334210_336070_" > One other phrase I&#x27;ll add here and then I&#x27;ll pause.</a><a name="ts_336230_342870_" > But one other phrase that I&#x27;ll say is that we think of this upper circuit of the vagus nerve</a><a name="ts_343310_348510_" > as prioritizing connection as a biological imperative.</a><a name="ts_348510_348928_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_348928_350900_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_350900_362340_" > I need connection to you in order for my psychobiology, my body, my mind, my, my capacity to digest my</a><a name="ts_362340_372160_" > food, my capacity to, to navigate this world, I need that connection, especially as infants.</a><a name="ts_372160_375510_" > We need those connections in order to survive.</a><a name="ts_375510_378740_" > A biological imperative.</a><a name="ts_379080_384860_" > So if we&#x27;re feeling rejected or isolated or alone, or we don&#x27;t feel like anyone&#x27;s around</a><a name="ts_384860_390460_" > us to support us, that feels like as real of a threat as if some other physical threat</a><a name="ts_390460_391648_" > was coming after us.</a><a name="ts_392570_395930_" > Especially if that was true for us when we were young.</a><a name="ts_396710_403110_" > One thing about my kind of career focus is on complex PTSD, especially as related to developmental</a><a name="ts_403110_403790_" > trauma.</a><a name="ts_403790_410850_" > And what that means is that it&#x27;s the accumulation of the experiences of lack of safety of the</a><a name="ts_410850_419170_" > dangerous experiences of the rejections of the not belonging of, of the betrayals that may</a><a name="ts_419170_421230_" > have gone on for many, many years.</a><a name="ts_421230_429490_" > And when that begins in early childhood or even in infancy, we basically have an impairment now</a><a name="ts_429490_435890_" > in that early wiring because that, that upper vagal pathway is experience dependent.</a><a name="ts_436270_443470_" > That basically means that I need those experiences of safety, those cues in order to develop that</a><a name="ts_443470_451350_" > within myself so that now I can basically cultivate a sense of connection and safety on the inside,</a><a name="ts_451630_453690_" > independent of whether someone else is there.</a><a name="ts_453690_454190_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_454190_459970_" > But that&#x27;s because I had enough of those early relational and of root systems that really</a><a name="ts_459970_461610_" > support the tree to grow.</a><a name="ts_462496_462960_" > Interesting.</a><a name="ts_463440_463560_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_463760_464840_" > And it makes so much sense.</a><a name="ts_465040_471620_" > And, and, um, I have four daughters and every one of them as a baby, they&#x27;re looking for your eyes.</a><a name="ts_471620_475280_" > Well, I mean, after about three weeks old when they could focus their eyes, but they&#x27;re constantly</a><a name="ts_475280_477280_" > scanning and looking for that eye contact.</a><a name="ts_477700_482080_" > They&#x27;re looking to see, is there someone here, you know, and, and we&#x27;re primed for that, right?</a><a name="ts_482080_484420_" > We&#x27;re wired to seek that safety.</a><a name="ts_484660_490570_" > So when, when, especially children don&#x27;t get that you&#x27;re saying that can impair the ability</a><a name="ts_490570_493760_" > to feel that felt sense of safety throughout their lives.</a><a name="ts_494368_493760_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_493760_495392_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_495392_502320_" > So another key component of the polyvagal theory is this idea that we go through a tiered response</a><a name="ts_502320_503280_" > to threat.</a><a name="ts_503480_503920_" > Oh yeah.</a><a name="ts_504060_510760_" > Meaning that we have kind of three levels that we go through in order to help us navigate a</a><a name="ts_510760_512060_" > potential threat out there.</a><a name="ts_512060_513000_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_513140_519620_" > The first of those is that if, you know, there, I experienced something that&#x27;s a queue of danger,</a><a name="ts_520380_522660_" > I&#x27;m going to seek connection.</a><a name="ts_522920_525600_" > I&#x27;m going to use this upper pathway.</a><a name="ts_525860_531140_" > Steve Borges, who developed the polyvagal theory, he refers to this as the social engagement</a><a name="ts_531140_531860_" > system.</a><a name="ts_532480_532560_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_532720_537420_" > The social engagement system is basically, can I make connection with you through eye contact</a><a name="ts_537420_539040_" > or calling out for help?</a><a name="ts_539560_541856_" > That&#x27;s going to help resolve that potential threat.</a><a name="ts_542528_541856_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_541856_543552_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_543552_549390_" > If I cannot establish that sense of safety and connection through the social engagement system,</a><a name="ts_549390_556370_" > the next layer of my threat response in this tiered response to threat is to go into the</a><a name="ts_556370_559170_" > fight flight system, which is our sympathetic nervous system.</a><a name="ts_559450_559630_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_559630_561430_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_561430_566910_" > And basically like how we mobilize our bodies to get away from the threat or protect ourselves</a><a name="ts_566910_567488_" > from it.</a><a name="ts_568096_572060_" > That&#x27;s so good that you highlight that because it&#x27;s something I&#x27;m completely aware of and I</a><a name="ts_572060_574640_" > forget to mention moving through those states.</a><a name="ts_574840_574920_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_574920_581720_" > So if we talk about like a deep, like I considered a default state of safety and then if something,</a><a name="ts_581740_586760_" > if something happens like, oh, I&#x27;m trying to think of a good example and I can&#x27;t, but the</a><a name="ts_586760_592140_" > first thing people do when something is like startling is they scan and they look for someone,</a><a name="ts_592380_592600_" > right?</a><a name="ts_592600_592660_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_592920_594640_" > They look to connect with someone.</a><a name="ts_594740_595280_" > Oh, am I okay?</a><a name="ts_595660_599120_" > And they look, their eyes get big and they&#x27;re looking for someone to connect with to create</a><a name="ts_599120_601200_" > a sense to see if they&#x27;re okay or they&#x27;re safe.</a><a name="ts_601200_602240_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_602740_603440_" > Or they&#x27;ll call out.</a><a name="ts_603660_603780_" > Ha!</a><a name="ts_604440_604600_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_604800_605920_" > And that&#x27;s communication.</a><a name="ts_606220_606980_" > That&#x27;s like communicating.</a><a name="ts_607440_608704_" > And they say, are you okay?</a><a name="ts_609280_609520_" > Oh yeah.</a><a name="ts_609540_609860_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_609960_610340_" > I&#x27;m okay.</a><a name="ts_610540_610700_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_611616_610976_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_611860_612260_" > It&#x27;s beautiful.</a><a name="ts_612580_615780_" > It&#x27;s so it&#x27;s built in kind of biologically wired in.</a><a name="ts_616060_622240_" > And I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s so important about the polyvagal theory is kind of recognizing that</a><a name="ts_622240_629520_" > like that, that desire within us to reestablish connection or, you know, kind of tend and befriend</a><a name="ts_629520_636140_" > through, through relational sources of safety, that is something that we&#x27;re wired for.</a><a name="ts_636600_641580_" > And that, you know, I think sometimes we can feel a sense of shame.</a><a name="ts_641800_643460_" > Like, why can&#x27;t I handle it on my own?</a><a name="ts_643560_648340_" > Or what&#x27;s wrong with me that I, you know, that I keep kind of reaching for other people</a><a name="ts_648340_651900_" > when I&#x27;m suffering, but actually that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re supposed to do.</a><a name="ts_652160_652560_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_652960_653220_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_653620_655120_" > You know, set up for that.</a><a name="ts_655300_656900_" > And there&#x27;s so much cultural messaging.</a><a name="ts_656900_661880_" > that&#x27;s like self-help when it&#x27;s like, like such individualized languaging, like our entire</a><a name="ts_661880_664080_" > culture is full of individualized language.</a><a name="ts_664320_670220_" > And it&#x27;s like, well, other help, like connection help might be more like valid and actually fulfilling</a><a name="ts_670220_675800_" > and restore that felt sense of safety more than just trying to be alone and feel like safe.</a><a name="ts_676240_676300_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_676440_676580_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_677240_677300_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_677660_678120_" > Interesting.</a><a name="ts_678320_679180_" > I love how you highlight that.</a><a name="ts_679180_679920_" > That&#x27;s so good.</a><a name="ts_680120_680440_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_681000_681120_" > All right.</a><a name="ts_681180_685440_" > So if we go back to the tiered response to threat, there&#x27;s three layers to this.</a><a name="ts_685600_687100_" > So the first is social connection.</a><a name="ts_687100_689120_" > The second is fight flight.</a><a name="ts_689340_693540_" > But let&#x27;s say we can&#x27;t run away from that source of danger.</a><a name="ts_693720_695560_" > Let&#x27;s say we can&#x27;t fight back.</a><a name="ts_695560_697000_" > We can&#x27;t protect ourselves.</a><a name="ts_697000_707040_" > the next layer that can come in is the basically a urge to withdraw, to hide, to get smaller,</a><a name="ts_707440_715200_" > to feel fatigued, to feel disoriented, or what we can sometimes even see as a feigned death</a><a name="ts_715200_719400_" > or a faint response, a deep collapse within the nervous system.</a><a name="ts_719400_723580_" > that once again is driven by the vagus nerve.</a><a name="ts_724040_726920_" > The sympathetic nervous system is not a vagal.</a><a name="ts_727580_730560_" > It&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s not driven by the vagal system.</a><a name="ts_730920_731260_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_732224_735310_" > But the social engagement system is the upper vagal pathway.</a><a name="ts_735710_743190_" > And this, what we call dorsal vagal faint death response or faint response is driven by</a><a name="ts_743190_747930_" > by the lower vagal system that goes into our organs.</a><a name="ts_747950_752480_" > But also has a kind of safety mechanism built into it.</a><a name="ts_753472_762560_" > And the urge to get very still, to get small, to immobilize in, in the context of a threat.</a><a name="ts_763100_770240_" > It&#x27;s, if we look at the animal world, right, we can see the ways in which going into stillness</a><a name="ts_770240_776860_" > and getting smaller or hiding would help an animal survive.</a><a name="ts_777300_777800_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_778260_780640_" > The respiration rate gets very slow.</a><a name="ts_780780_788500_" > The heart rate slows down in order to be less noticeable by a potential predator out there.</a><a name="ts_788720_789280_" > Mm hmm.</a><a name="ts_789780_796960_" > And in the cases of what we would call a full vasovagal syncope, right, is a faint response.</a><a name="ts_796960_807020_" > That vasovagal syncope is basically taking us into a full on collapse state in the way you can think of a possum.</a><a name="ts_807260_807760_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_807920_815640_" > That also often accompanies nausea, dizziness, disorientation, sometimes loss of bowel control.</a><a name="ts_816220_822940_" > But if we go back to the animal world for a moment, those experiences, like if we go back to the possum,</a><a name="ts_823040_828340_" > if the possum goes into a feigned death response, it often emits a foul smell.</a><a name="ts_828340_829820_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_829820_837690_" > And if a predator approaches it and senses that says, ooh, like maybe you&#x27;ve been poisoned.</a><a name="ts_837690_840470_" > And if I eat you, I&#x27;ll get poisoned too.</a><a name="ts_841090_848360_" > So we as humans have way of ways of deterring the predator out there.</a><a name="ts_848620_849040_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_849600_860260_" > Feigning death, becoming less interesting, becoming smaller, hiding away, feeling like I, you know, I just want to stay in bed.</a><a name="ts_860260_868540_" > I have lots of conversations with a colleague of mine, Deb Dana, who also teaches a lot about applied polyvagal theory and psychotherapy.</a><a name="ts_868780_872120_" > And she, you know, she and I have different ways of describing this.</a><a name="ts_872260_876920_" > You know, I kind of call it like I want to go into my cocoon and she calls it her duvet day.</a><a name="ts_877120_881200_" > It&#x27;s like the day you just want to pull the duvet up and be like, I&#x27;m not getting out of bed today.</a><a name="ts_881200_881500_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_881720_881960_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_882160_882500_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_882520_885540_" > You just want to curl up, cover up, hide, not move.</a><a name="ts_886020_886340_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_886460_887500_" > I feel that.</a><a name="ts_887700_888288_" > I feel that.</a><a name="ts_889024_897020_" > This is maybe a tangent, but where, where would you put the like fawn response or the people pleasing response within the polyvagal?</a><a name="ts_897040_898420_" > I&#x27;ve heard various takes on this.</a><a name="ts_898520_899260_" > I&#x27;d like to hear yours.</a><a name="ts_899700_899860_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_900120_900220_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_900400_907640_" > So generally the way that we think about the fawn response is we call it a hybrid nervous system state.</a><a name="ts_907640_912260_" > And that it&#x27;s engaging that social engagement system.</a><a name="ts_912900_916040_" > But there&#x27;s also a sympathetic vigilance.</a><a name="ts_916420_923620_" > And now when we look at kind of both of those co-activations of sympathetic, I know that there&#x27;s a threat out there.</a><a name="ts_923740_924460_" > I&#x27;m trying to navigate.</a><a name="ts_924660_927040_" > I&#x27;m trying to mobilize to take care of that threat.</a><a name="ts_927180_933540_" > But how I mobilize, how I move in response to that threat is through taking care of you.</a><a name="ts_934080_938112_" > If I take care of you, maybe you won&#x27;t hurt me.</a><a name="ts_938688_944500_" > If I take care of you, maybe I can take care of you enough that you&#x27;ll take care of me.</a><a name="ts_945040_954640_" > And so we recruit in a sense that social engagement capacity to sense what somebody else is feeling, sense what they might be needing.</a><a name="ts_954640_962800_" > And then we go into some kind of people pleasing or appeasement behavior in order to promote our own safety.</a><a name="ts_963360_963584_" > Mm-hmm.</a><a name="ts_963584_964600_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_964600_967200_" > So within polyvagal, would that be a sympathetic state usually?</a><a name="ts_967500_968500_" > Or mixed state?</a><a name="ts_968600_969980_" > You would consider it a mixed state.</a><a name="ts_970080_970640_" > That&#x27;s what you were saying.</a><a name="ts_971160_971340_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_971340_971660_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_971680_972720_" > It&#x27;s a mixed state.</a><a name="ts_972720_979560_" > So we can think of pulling in the recruiting the vagus nerve of that social engagement system.</a><a name="ts_979580_979960_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_980180_983220_" > And co-activating the sympathetic mobilization.</a><a name="ts_983600_983840_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_984080_984420_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_984520_985400_" > That makes sense to me.</a><a name="ts_985500_986340_" > That makes sense to me.</a><a name="ts_986460_991060_" > I&#x27;ve heard some people place it within like the shutdown response or the dorsal vagal response.</a><a name="ts_991420_994620_" > And it has never quite sat right with me because it is so activated.</a><a name="ts_994620_995940_" > It&#x27;s such an activated state.</a><a name="ts_995940_996700_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_997100_1003700_" > There&#x27;s a, there&#x27;s a closely related state to the fawn response that I think doesn&#x27;t get discussed as much.</a><a name="ts_1003960_1007980_" > And this one we&#x27;ll call the submission response.</a><a name="ts_1008200_1008960_" > There you go.</a><a name="ts_1009504_1008960_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1008960_1010000_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1010000_1017080_" > And what happens here, and again, we&#x27;ll describe this as a hybrid or co-activation of nervous system states.</a><a name="ts_1017160_1025640_" > But what happens here is I&#x27;m still recruiting my, my social engagement system in order to keep that biological</a><a name="ts_1025640_1039410_" > imperative of connection up and running, but the person who is, who I&#x27;m trying to connect to my attachment person or my partner is also a source of harm.</a><a name="ts_1039950_1040150_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1040370_1052880_" > And so now in order to keep that, that biological, you know, imperative of connection in order to uphold my need for relationship with you.</a><a name="ts_1052880_1059020_" > I actually have to submit to the harm that&#x27;s occurring.</a><a name="ts_1059020_1065440_" > I go into an immobilization, which would be that, that more collapsed state.</a><a name="ts_1066208_1070900_" > And sometimes what happens with the submit state is that I have to dissociate.</a><a name="ts_1071300_1081460_" > I have to dissociate from what my body knows about that harm in order to stay in relationship with that same person.</a><a name="ts_1081840_1082200_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1082600_1090470_" > So it might be like, like a teenager whose, whose parent is really controlling or just setting really strong boundaries that they really don&#x27;t like.</a><a name="ts_1090570_1092064_" > And they say, fine, I don&#x27;t care.</a><a name="ts_1092672_1093640_" > And he&#x27;s like, I don&#x27;t care.</a><a name="ts_1093720_1094800_" > That&#x27;s a form of dissociation.</a><a name="ts_1094840_1096840_" > I&#x27;m not going to feel this anymore or fine.</a><a name="ts_1096940_1098260_" > I&#x27;ll just go along with it.</a><a name="ts_1098420_1102580_" > And that could, that could be on various levels of, of severity, right?</a><a name="ts_1102660_1107880_" > We could take that to a much more severe state, but it&#x27;s like, I don&#x27;t care.</a><a name="ts_1107880_1113100_" > Or I&#x27;m just not going to care or I&#x27;m going to stay in this relationship and I&#x27;ll be numb and I&#x27;ll just give in, you know, like that.</a><a name="ts_1113260_1115120_" > And I&#x27;ll do whatever you tell me to do.</a><a name="ts_1115540_1116340_" > And that makes sense.</a><a name="ts_1117060_1117380_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1117400_1118340_" > I&#x27;ll just go along with it.</a><a name="ts_1118440_1118960_" > I&#x27;ll comply.</a><a name="ts_1119040_1123000_" > I&#x27;ll be submissive, try and like not make things hurt worse.</a><a name="ts_1123000_1129260_" > And yeah, you&#x27;ll see this in marriages where people go through these stages where they&#x27;re like, Hey, we&#x27;re in love.</a><a name="ts_1129360_1129620_" > We&#x27;re great.</a><a name="ts_1129700_1130100_" > We&#x27;re awesome.</a><a name="ts_1130320_1132000_" > And then they go through like, Oh, we&#x27;re fighting a lot.</a><a name="ts_1132100_1135360_" > And then when they go to the last state, it&#x27;s like, we&#x27;re detached.</a><a name="ts_1135760_1137540_" > We don&#x27;t really care about each other.</a><a name="ts_1137740_1139640_" > We don&#x27;t really talk about the issues anymore.</a><a name="ts_1139920_1144140_" > We just kind of like, and then they&#x27;re like, just living as roommates, right?</a><a name="ts_1144320_1146040_" > I really appreciate polyvagal theory.</a><a name="ts_1146240_1150720_" > And I think it&#x27;s so applicable before we talk about how to restore a sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_1150720_1152140_" > How would you describe trauma?</a><a name="ts_1152960_1154350_" > Can you give us that in a nutshell?</a><a name="ts_1155150_1156790_" > Yeah, there you go.</a><a name="ts_1156970_1157630_" > What is trauma?</a><a name="ts_1157810_1180850_" > Anything that overwhelms our capacity to integrate an experience, our ordinary human capacity to make sense of and have integrated into my overall sense of identity and who I am as a person to make that experience that I had useful in some way to process it.</a><a name="ts_1180850_1184090_" > We want to use that word to kind of process through what happened.</a><a name="ts_1184570_1195610_" > And I like the definitions of trauma that are out there that emphasize more what has happened on the inside of an individual versus what was the event itself.</a><a name="ts_1195610_1206050_" > Because I think if we identify trauma as an external event, it feels like it just happened to me and there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it.</a><a name="ts_1206190_1223648_" > When we locate trauma as the internal event, the emotions, the somatic experience that I had in relationship to something, then I can actually do something with that interior landscape of who I am.</a><a name="ts_1224352_1225180_" > I love that.</a><a name="ts_1225380_1225800_" > I love that.</a><a name="ts_1225940_1236020_" > And one of the things I&#x27;m noticing a lot on social media is there&#x27;s a lot of conversations about, hey, the reason you feel insecure is because your parents did such and such and such when you were a child.</a><a name="ts_1236200_1237900_" > And I don&#x27;t want to invalidate that.</a><a name="ts_1238020_1240620_" > I don&#x27;t want to say, like, that&#x27;s not the case.</a><a name="ts_1241260_1245260_" > And of course, there&#x27;s a broad spectrum of parenting out there.</a><a name="ts_1245260_1246460_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1246460_1254570_" > But what happens is some of the most comforting messages out there on social media are basically saying trauma was not your fault.</a><a name="ts_1254630_1255410_" > It&#x27;s caused by your parents.</a><a name="ts_1255490_1256010_" > It&#x27;s in the past.</a><a name="ts_1256090_1257350_" > And now you&#x27;re broken because of it.</a><a name="ts_1257530_1259010_" > And it&#x27;s like, no, no, no, no, no.</a><a name="ts_1259010_1263230_" > Trauma is a response, like a response to an event that happened.</a><a name="ts_1263410_1268710_" > And it&#x27;s a response that&#x27;s continuing to go on in your nervous system because you haven&#x27;t integrated it.</a><a name="ts_1268930_1280580_" > And because it&#x27;s continuing in the present moment, I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s your fault, but there is an opportunity here in this moment to practice responding differently to those experiences.</a><a name="ts_1280580_1288860_" > Not to invalidate someone&#x27;s experience, but we got to remind people that we do have capacity within our nervous system to create change.</a><a name="ts_1289560_1289640_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1290100_1291860_" > And there&#x27;s a few pieces to name about this.</a><a name="ts_1291980_1295960_" > One is that, like, if you put several people in the same situation.</a><a name="ts_1296220_1296520_" > Oh, yeah.</a><a name="ts_1297160_1297320_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1297480_1299060_" > You know, like, let&#x27;s say a car accident.</a><a name="ts_1299440_1304040_" > Not everyone in that car might would feel traumatized by what happened.</a><a name="ts_1304220_1308160_" > It depends on were we able to respond and we feel effective, right?</a><a name="ts_1308160_1319920_" > One of the classic studies done by a colleague of mine with lanius speaks about a car accident in which one person in the car went into more of a collapsed immobilization, right?</a><a name="ts_1320040_1329640_" > Like that basically you can froze frozen and the partner mobilized, pulled her out of the car before it caught on fire, saved their lives.</a><a name="ts_1329780_1329880_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1330080_1336940_" > And so the the even though it was objectively a traumatic event that they both went through.</a><a name="ts_1336940_1346540_" > She suffered from more post-traumatic stress because her body basically went into a place where she struggled to respond.</a><a name="ts_1346560_1353760_" > But because he took action in that moment, he didn&#x27;t have the same symptoms afterwards of post-traumatic stress.</a><a name="ts_1353760_1354400_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1354400_1373000_" > And I&#x27;ve seen that in my work so often that that that that if we were able to kind of complete an action, then our bodies feel in some sense like the process had an arc and I&#x27;m okay, I did something.</a><a name="ts_1373000_1389700_" > And Peter Levine, who developed somatic experiencing, he often says that what is housed in the interior experience of post-traumatic stress is the incomplete actions or the thwarted actions that didn&#x27;t get to happen.</a><a name="ts_1389700_1397200_" > I didn&#x27;t get to climb my way out or call for help or reach for connection or say no.</a><a name="ts_1397200_1398400_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1398400_1398900_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1399360_1404200_" > And then that gets kind of stuck and your body gets trapped in that in that state because it hasn&#x27;t moved through it.</a><a name="ts_1404200_1404460_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1405160_1405400_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_1405460_1421980_" > And that ties us back to the nervous system because when we look through the lens of the nervous system, when we have an incomplete action, we&#x27;re basically cycling back around either the experience of an urge to flee.</a><a name="ts_1421980_1430180_" > And we&#x27;re always looking for the exit plan, we&#x27;re restless, irritable, we we don&#x27;t feel comfortable resting in stillness in ourselves.</a><a name="ts_1430620_1434120_" > Maybe conversely, we&#x27;re constantly stuck in a fight response.</a><a name="ts_1434120_1437260_" > We&#x27;re always kind of looking for the next battle.</a><a name="ts_1437980_1440300_" > And again, it becomes hard to rest.</a><a name="ts_1440460_1441940_" > There&#x27;s a lot of muscular tension.</a><a name="ts_1442060_1444120_" > We feel vigilant.</a><a name="ts_1444120_1445820_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_1445820_1452540_" > Or sometimes where we get stuck is in that place of no matter what I do, it&#x27;s not going to make a difference.</a><a name="ts_1452820_1454240_" > So what&#x27;s the point of trying?</a><a name="ts_1454980_1461560_" > And that state of collapse is what is known internally by the individual.</a><a name="ts_1461720_1466440_" > And therefore, we just keep returning to what is known.</a><a name="ts_1466980_1470580_" > Yeah, when our stress levels increase or whatever, we&#x27;re quick to revert back to that.</a><a name="ts_1470580_1471440_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1471940_1472100_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1472380_1482880_" > Yeah, I often, getting stuck in this trauma response, I often use the analogy of it&#x27;s like watching The Lion King and right after Mufasa dies, turning it off because that&#x27;s so stressful.</a><a name="ts_1483460_1488800_" > Now, every time you think of The Lion King, the only thing you can think of is that stress response.</a><a name="ts_1488920_1499720_" > And if Simba, like, never, if the movie stopped right there, Simba&#x27;s stuck in shame and helplessness and guilt for the rest of his life.</a><a name="ts_1499720_1500980_" > If we just stopped the movie there.</a><a name="ts_1501140_1508820_" > And if we keep playing through that movie, we come to this place where he works through his shame and he understands he wasn&#x27;t actually at fault.</a><a name="ts_1509040_1513220_" > And he goes back to Pride Rock and he takes action to, like, save Pride Rock, right?</a><a name="ts_1513320_1519620_" > He&#x27;s mobilizing and he&#x27;s working through this process instead of getting stuck, like, turning off the movie right when that stopped.</a><a name="ts_1519620_1525600_" > And then he has this lovely experience with his dad, his spirit dad, and, and it&#x27;s all resolved.</a><a name="ts_1525800_1531900_" > And I think, I mean, if only resolving trauma was easy as watching a movie, but that is the process, right?</a><a name="ts_1532240_1532840_" > Like working.</a><a name="ts_1532840_1534140_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1534140_1536340_" > It&#x27;s such a perfect movie example.</a><a name="ts_1536340_1536420_" > That&#x27;s wonderful.</a><a name="ts_1536700_1538140_" > And, and thank you for bringing that in.</a><a name="ts_1538260_1547460_" > And I have another kind of example along similar lines that I use when I&#x27;m teaching about the, you know, kind of processing through the incomplete experience of trauma.</a><a name="ts_1547460_1550980_" > Our minds are always looking for how does the story end?</a><a name="ts_1551160_1552600_" > It&#x27;s just how we think, right?</a><a name="ts_1552800_1553100_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1553100_1562400_" > And I remember one time I was going to teach a training for therapists and, and I was traveling from Colorado where I live to Ohio.</a><a name="ts_1562400_1567300_" > And I had started the movie a little bit too late into the, into the airplane flight.</a><a name="ts_1567540_1572740_" > And so by the time we landed, we had, I had 20 minutes of the movie yet unwatched, right?</a><a name="ts_1572920_1573020_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1573180_1573560_" > There you go.</a><a name="ts_1573920_1579780_" > And it was a great movie, but my mind for like the rest of the evening was like, well, how did it end?</a><a name="ts_1579920_1580840_" > Did it end this way?</a><a name="ts_1580920_1581540_" > Did it end that way?</a><a name="ts_1581640_1582600_" > Do I want to Google it?</a><a name="ts_1582780_1584520_" > Because then I, my mind can finally rest.</a><a name="ts_1584660_1587580_" > Do I want to wait till I get on the return flight to watch the ending?</a><a name="ts_1587980_1588260_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1588640_1588800_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1588800_1606330_" > But that&#x27;s how, that&#x27;s what happens with trauma is that when we have the incomplete experience, there is some way in which our brains are basically wired to live on repeat inside of, but wait, how is it going to end?</a><a name="ts_1606530_1608690_" > What&#x27;s the ending of this story?</a><a name="ts_1608990_1614830_" > And how can I take an active part in creating the ending of this story?</a><a name="ts_1615470_1621530_" > And, you know, and that&#x27;s partially kind of going to lead into this next question of like, how do we create safety?</a><a name="ts_1621930_1622290_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1622610_1622890_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1623808_1623104_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1623104_1624140_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1624140_1628360_" > So, and, and I mean, one of the things you&#x27;re describing is something that can be done with narrative therapy, right?</a><a name="ts_1628420_1635360_" > People can write out their, their trauma story and say, with an ending, they call this a contamination story of like, well, and that&#x27;s how I got broken.</a><a name="ts_1635600_1636900_" > That&#x27;s how my life got ruined.</a><a name="ts_1637140_1642140_" > Or you can write this story and say, okay, let&#x27;s write a redemption story at the second half of this.</a><a name="ts_1642140_1646480_" > And we&#x27;re going to, even if it hasn&#x27;t happened yet, let&#x27;s visualize this, but that&#x27;s a form of cognitive therapy.</a><a name="ts_1646660_1648500_" > That&#x27;s a form of like word therapy.</a><a name="ts_1648980_1651020_" > How do we do this with our nervous system?</a><a name="ts_1651140_1652680_" > How do we do this with our bodies?</a><a name="ts_1653440_1653600_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1653760_1655140_" > And I think we need both.</a><a name="ts_1655340_1657640_" > Like, I just want to pause on the narrative piece on this.</a><a name="ts_1657820_1660560_" > I, one of my books is called the Post Traumatic Growth Guidebook.</a><a name="ts_1660660_1669920_" > And the, and the purpose of that book was basically to guide the reader through a narrative therapy journey of how do you write through your own trauma story?</a><a name="ts_1669920_1674960_" > And the book includes polyvagal theory and it includes somatics.</a><a name="ts_1675220_1682140_" > And so, so it, it&#x27;s kind of weaving in the both end because as humans, we are storytellers.</a><a name="ts_1682960_1687320_" > And in some ways we also, as part of healing, need that truth telling.</a><a name="ts_1687320_1697480_" > We need our stories to be known by us and to be heard by others in order to feel validated and in order to have some redemptive elements to it.</a><a name="ts_1697960_1698100_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1698340_1700380_" > And then let&#x27;s include the body.</a><a name="ts_1700680_1701184_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1701856_1701184_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1702150_1726520_" > So when we look at the remnants of trauma as they live inside of us, we might notice chronic tension patterns, chronic vigilance patterns, the way that it interrupts our sleep, the way that interrupts our digestion or our, like kind of all of those rhythms of that are also where trauma intersects physically with our health.</a><a name="ts_1726520_1727300_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1727700_1727960_" > Oh yeah.</a><a name="ts_1728080_1737240_" > If we&#x27;re in chronic states of fight flight and that sympathetic nervous system that is sent a sense in essence is living on repeat.</a><a name="ts_1737660_1745140_" > We are basically staying in more of an elevated heart rate, elevated respiratory rate.</a><a name="ts_1745140_1748260_" > It&#x27;s going to impair that rest and digest system.</a><a name="ts_1748260_1749420_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1749420_1765320_" > And conversely, sometimes where we&#x27;re stuck in post-traumatic responses is in more of that collapse, depression, nothing&#x27;s going to make a difference, fatigue, malaise.</a><a name="ts_1765620_1766800_" > Like I have no appetite.</a><a name="ts_1766800_1768180_" > I can&#x27;t feel anything.</a><a name="ts_1768180_1769460_" > I can&#x27;t even cry.</a><a name="ts_1769960_1771680_" > Like I feel dead inside, right?</a><a name="ts_1771820_1773740_" > That dissociate, but like in the body, right?</a><a name="ts_1773840_1775280_" > That the heavy feeling.</a><a name="ts_1775640_1776240_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_1776440_1777900_" > So let&#x27;s start there.</a><a name="ts_1777900_1789000_" > Let&#x27;s say that that heaviness that again, maybe depressive thinking or more despairing thoughts are where we&#x27;re stuck.</a><a name="ts_1789480_1794620_" > One of the phrases that we, that we sometimes use in the applied polyvagal theory model.</a><a name="ts_1794780_1800020_" > And this comes from Deb Dana is this idea of climbing up the polyvagal ladder.</a><a name="ts_1800020_1800860_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1801500_1813680_" > In the sense that we have to go from that dorsal vagal shutdown and collapse back through mobilization in order to come back to social connection.</a><a name="ts_1814060_1818060_" > And we think about reversing that tiered response to threat.</a><a name="ts_1818060_1824760_" > So we can&#x27;t, we can&#x27;t go from a state of shutdown to a state of like, I feel calm, safe and relaxed.</a><a name="ts_1824760_1828500_" > We have to go through like a little bit of an activated state.</a><a name="ts_1828500_1829600_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1829800_1830120_" > Sometimes.</a><a name="ts_1830480_1833160_" > And I&#x27;ll say that like, that&#x27;s one of the trajectories.</a><a name="ts_1833480_1836320_" > It, it doesn&#x27;t mean that we always have to do that.</a><a name="ts_1836420_1844140_" > There are actually ways of layering in that sense of relational safety right into that collapse and shutdown.</a><a name="ts_1844140_1844780_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_1845240_1850180_" > And in a sense, kind of help us to maybe then reclaim mobilization.</a><a name="ts_1850180_1852680_" > So I don&#x27;t always put it quite as linear.</a><a name="ts_1853500_1858400_" > But, and I think that the field is continuing to understand this and that&#x27;s what&#x27;s beautiful about it.</a><a name="ts_1858560_1865560_" > But very often, at some point in the trauma recovery journey, we do need to remobilize.</a><a name="ts_1865560_1881600_" > We do need to embrace our stress response to be friend it and to recognize its value in helping us to feel empowered and alive and energized.</a><a name="ts_1881600_1883780_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_1883780_1884180_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_1884280_1897220_" > So that if we are feeling collapsed, how do we re embrace a little bit of, all right, I can look around, right?</a><a name="ts_1897220_1917380_" > I&#x27;m going to just model for a moment, the one of the most simple and subtle remobilizations that is so necessary for our nervous system, which is literally to use our orienting response and to find something that serves as a cue of safety.</a><a name="ts_1918080_1918944_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_1919776_1926520_" > And even though it&#x27;s a subtle movement, I am still turning my head.</a><a name="ts_1926520_1947940_" > I am looking with my eyes and whether that point of connection and safety is with another person, you know, right here with you, or whether that&#x27;s point of connection is through an object or an item from nature, a plant.</a><a name="ts_1947940_1954700_" > Or if I look out my window, I see our sunflowers in our backyard, it&#x27;s late summer and the finches love to land on them.</a><a name="ts_1954860_1957040_" > And it&#x27;s such a delight to watch them.</a><a name="ts_1957220_1958320_" > They&#x27;re like acrobats.</a><a name="ts_1958480_1959560_" > They hang upside down.</a><a name="ts_1959560_1960580_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1960580_1963220_" > Sometimes the squirrels get on them and that&#x27;s really fun.</a><a name="ts_1963320_1964100_" > Pulling out those little seeds.</a><a name="ts_1964420_1964740_" > Awesome.</a><a name="ts_1964740_1965280_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1965520_1966020_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_1966360_1983140_" > But like all of a sudden you can feel like, oh, I&#x27;m orienting my attention to something other than the trauma as it lives inside of me or as it lives inside of the mental stories about that.</a><a name="ts_1983140_1990144_" > I&#x27;m orienting to something that is, even if it&#x27;s neutral, it&#x27;s a sign of okayness right now.</a><a name="ts_1990912_1990144_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_1990144_1992096_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_1992096_1992470_" > I love that.</a><a name="ts_1992570_1997750_" > And I saw that exercise in your book and I thought, oh, this is such a simple and basic exercise.</a><a name="ts_1997750_2005810_" > But it, like, there&#x27;s two things that send cues to the body and one is your outside environment, which is safe usually, right?</a><a name="ts_2005870_2008410_" > Your environment in your room, I&#x27;m actually safe here.</a><a name="ts_2008650_2013030_" > And that sends a message like through your eyeballs into your body and your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_2013470_2020570_" > But also just the act of moving your head and opening your eyes and expanding your peripheral vision, right?</a><a name="ts_2020570_2030810_" > That also sends a message from your body up through your nervous system to your brain to say, I&#x27;m like, if I can move my eyes and I can see around me like I am safe, right?</a><a name="ts_2031110_2031610_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_2031750_2032290_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_2032330_2032790_" > It&#x27;s beautiful.</a><a name="ts_2032990_2034270_" > And we actually need, right?</a><a name="ts_2034450_2040050_" > It&#x27;s one of the reasons why we need safe enough environments now to unwind the trauma.</a><a name="ts_2040050_2053590_" > And it&#x27;s also speaks to one of the biggest challenges in our world is that sometimes the trauma is ongoing and there isn&#x27;t enough current safety to heal from the past.</a><a name="ts_2053750_2056230_" > And so instead we&#x27;re still, you know, kind of bracing.</a><a name="ts_2056230_2069450_" > And when I am working with individuals where there is ongoing exposure to trauma, we need an essence kind of, you know, like, like safe hubs in the midst of this world.</a><a name="ts_2069450_2088768_" > So we can kind of find the smaller temporary spaces where this current moment isn&#x27;t safe enough to reorient to yourself, your breath, your body without feeling chronically overwhelmed.</a><a name="ts_2088768_2090560_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2090560_2096780_" > Yeah, it&#x27;s so easy to do with our ability to hear about pain and suffering or threats in the world.</a><a name="ts_2096780_2099680_" > It&#x27;s so easy to feel like we&#x27;re always unsafe.</a><a name="ts_2099680_2101460_" > And so I like that.</a><a name="ts_2101640_2102760_" > I like two things you said.</a><a name="ts_2102900_2103840_" > One is safe enough.</a><a name="ts_2104060_2105100_" > I&#x27;m safe enough now.</a><a name="ts_2105420_2114280_" > And to focus on like a hub, an area, like, or even sometimes I think about this as like, oh, I can&#x27;t do everything to make the whole world safe.</a><a name="ts_2114500_2114840_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_2114960_2120000_" > I can&#x27;t do everything to eliminate all the threats that I might read in the New York Times or whatever.</a><a name="ts_2120000_2124160_" > But I can, within my sphere, within my home, I can foster safety.</a><a name="ts_2124360_2129340_" > In my backyard, I can foster safety with my children, try and be a safe place for them.</a><a name="ts_2129440_2133344_" > And I can feel safe with them, you know?</a><a name="ts_2134208_2134900_" > Yeah, yeah.</a><a name="ts_2135100_2148440_" > And I, and you just named something so key in this, which is that when I am capable of generating that within myself, I can also then generate it outside of myself.</a><a name="ts_2148440_2155440_" > So it brings us back to another key element of the polyvagal theory, which is something that we call co-regulation.</a><a name="ts_2155440_2170100_" > When I&#x27;m regulating my nervous system, or maybe receiving the co-regulation from a safe enough environment, I can then become a co-regulator for others, in this case, your children, right?</a><a name="ts_2170300_2180896_" > And so it be, it becomes something that, that is a bit of a ripple effect outward as we generate more of that positive state.</a><a name="ts_2181568_2190560_" > Yeah, and I immediately felt that interacting with you, like, you emanate that, and it helps me calm down, because I get a little worked up about all the things I have to do for my interviews.</a><a name="ts_2190820_2192680_" > And so, like, I can see you expressing that.</a><a name="ts_2192760_2202700_" > And we all, I think we can all, I hope, everyone can identify someone in their lives who they can interact with that helps them feel a little bit safe or secure.</a><a name="ts_2203648_2205910_" > A lot safer secure would be great.</a><a name="ts_2206688_2208990_" > I think, I think, in your book, you mentioned that, right?</a><a name="ts_2208990_2210848_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2210848_2217312_" > Talking about, like, identifying a safe person, or even visualizing a safe person who&#x27;s not present, right?</a><a name="ts_2217856_2218620_" > Yeah, it&#x27;s true.</a><a name="ts_2218800_2222780_" > And sometimes we can draw upon real people in our lives.</a><a name="ts_2222780_2241940_" > And sometimes we have to draw upon allies, even allies that we&#x27;ve never met, but allies that have been, you know, like maybe a public figure or historical figure that have served as represent representatives of what that safe relationship could feel like.</a><a name="ts_2241940_2250460_" > And one of my favorite examples of this, and someone I grew up with, and maybe not as relevant for younger generations, but I grew up watching Mr. Rogers.</a><a name="ts_2250740_2253160_" > I loved Mr. Rogers.</a><a name="ts_2253460_2262180_" > If you, you know, if the viewers here have not seen the documentary about his show, I highly recommend it because you just bring your tissues with you.</a><a name="ts_2262180_2284720_" > Like, it&#x27;s so beautiful because what he intended in his show that was on, you know, PBS Public Broadcasting System was to be that offering of validation and kindness and generosity and compassion for children, really, you know, throughout our country, and I&#x27;m going to say beyond.</a><a name="ts_2284720_2312080_" > And so, you know, he&#x27;s someone that I can pull on in my consciousness as a presence that brings that feeling of how, you know, of what goodness should feel like and we can one spiritual presences and we can pull on even our animal presences, right, our pets, as those allies of what safety can and should feel like.</a><a name="ts_2312080_2313120_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2313340_2314140_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2314240_2314360_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2314360_2315060_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2315060_2315540_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2315640_2317140_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2317520_2321430_" > I think we could all, like, come up with someone like that in our lives.</a><a name="ts_2321930_2322730_" > I hope so.</a><a name="ts_2323130_2323850_" > That&#x27;s cool.</a><a name="ts_2324050_2324250_" > I hope so.</a><a name="ts_2324470_2324710_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2325430_2325670_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_2326390_2332290_" > Um, do you have another exercise or activity you&#x27;d be willing to share that can help us restore our sense of safety?</a><a name="ts_2332870_2333170_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2333570_2341990_" > So, you know, part of what, for me, as a somatic practitioner and as a yoga teacher, part of what I come back to again and again,</a><a name="ts_2341990_2356090_" > are what are the sources of safety that that do live inside of us that therefore no matter where we are in the world, no matter what we&#x27;re doing, we can tap into that which comes with us everywhere.</a><a name="ts_2356530_2356590_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_2356710_2356790_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2356790_2361330_" > And, and this doesn&#x27;t mean that we don&#x27;t also need each other.</a><a name="ts_2361450_2377110_" > This is not a replacement for the social forms of connection and safety, but it&#x27;s a kind of once we have the foundation of those co-regulating sources of connection, we can then carry that inside of us.</a><a name="ts_2377110_2385690_" > So, you know, for example, right before coming in to do this interview with you, I spent an hour on my yoga mat, which is, you know, pretty much my morning routine.</a><a name="ts_2385690_2386990_" > I have a meditation practice.</a><a name="ts_2387170_2397890_" > I have a yoga practice and the practices that I engage in, which are basically an applied polyvagal theory in yoga, or I just generally call it vagus nerve yoga.</a><a name="ts_2397890_2401630_" > And it&#x27;s my YouTube channel, you can, you know, can find it under Dr. Ariel Schwartz.</a><a name="ts_2401810_2408060_" > But there&#x27;s basically, you know, lots of tools that we have inside of us.</a><a name="ts_2408160_2414848_" > And the basics that I&#x27;ll share here are your breath and your posture, your spine.</a><a name="ts_2414848_2416290_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2416290_2427136_" > Because when we think about both of those, and I&#x27;ll, and I&#x27;ll share about each one, and I&#x27;ll kind of share just some basic practice around this, is that your breath mirrors your nervous system.</a><a name="ts_2427872_2431920_" > Every inhalation will key in a little bit of your sympathetic nervous system.</a><a name="ts_2432220_2436224_" > Every exhalation brings in a little bit of parasympathetic quieting.</a><a name="ts_2436928_2436224_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2436928_2450250_" > When we look at the health of the autonomic nervous system, and this relates to safety, what we want to see is this ability to move pretty fluidly between sympathetic and parasympathetic.</a><a name="ts_2450650_2465040_" > We feel unsafe if we&#x27;re stuck in sympathetic, right, activation, vigilance, irritability, restlessness, anxiety, panic, and we feel unsafe if we&#x27;re stuck in the parasympathetic nervous system.</a><a name="ts_2465040_2471040_" > We feel shut down, heavy, again, more depressed, more despair, more collapse.</a><a name="ts_2471340_2480040_" > So when we look at the health of the autonomic nervous system, we are wanting to restore this rhythm of sympathetic

Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2486420_2490040_" > So basic practice is rhythmic breathing.</a><a name="ts_2490040_2490860_" > Mm-hmm.</a><a name="ts_2491260_2504736_" > When I inhale for, let&#x27;s say, four

shutdown and depression.</a><a name="ts_2541480_2541560_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2541560_2561376_" > So our rhythmic breathing that allows for an even inhale and exhale is restoring the rhythm of the nervous system.</a><a name="ts_2561376_2564032_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_2564032_2573408_" > And from the bottom up, from your body to your brain via your vagus nerve, sending signals of safety back to

to grieve, valid when we&#x27;re sad, valid when we feel helpless or powerless.</a><a name="ts_2604800_2608832_" > We just don&#x27;t want to live here all of the time.</a><a

to curl upon ourselves, right?</a><a name="ts_2617400_2620700_" > In yoga, we would go into a child&#x27;s pose or a forward fold.</a><a name="ts_2620700_2627168_" > And it allows us to make contact with what our body knows from this shape.</a><a name="ts_2627168_2629280_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2629280_2634110_" > And in its opposite, sometimes we go into spinal extension.</a><a name="ts_2634110_2637080_" > This is going to lift my gaze.</a><a name="ts_2637240_2642040_" > It&#x27;s going to bring more breath into the upper chest.</a><a name="ts_2642040_2644640_" > It&#x27;s going to be more sympathetic in nature.</a><a name="ts_2644900_2650740_" > I&#x27;m going to be very aware of my surrounds and I&#x27;m able to respond to what&#x27;s happening out there.</a><a

name="ts_2658720_2677550_" > So when we&#x27;re looking at the health of the autonomic nervous system as related to posture, once again, we can see how rhythmic postural transitions, like in the yogic

name="ts_2686740_2691710_" > So when we put it all together, my favorite practice, and I love it.</a><a name="ts_2691790_2693050_" > You&#x27;re like, oh yeah, I feel it.</a><a name="ts_2693170_2693270_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_2693430_2695650_" > Every time you talk about breath, though, it brings your awareness.</a><a name="ts_2695750_2697370_" > You&#x27;re like, oh yeah, don&#x27;t forget to breathe.</a><a name="ts_2697710_2699890_" > You know, we all do, right?</a><a name="ts_2699890_2700670_" > We all do.</a><a name="ts_2700810_2709410_" > That&#x27;s, you know, I, I think what I love about polyvagal theory is it&#x27;s a compassionate way to understand ourselves, our tendencies and our symptoms.</a><a name="ts_2709410_2715430_" > It&#x27;s so important when we speak about trauma recovery to not use these things against ourselves.</a><a name="ts_2715650_2719670_" > If only I could breathe, if only I were blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?</a><a name="ts_2720110_2731730_" > Like our tendencies to hold our breath, our tendencies to breathe shallowly, our tendencies to be stuck in kind of postural inefficiencies, if you want to think about it that way.</a><a name="ts_2731930_2733664_" > That&#x27;s just called being human.</a><a name="ts_2733664_2734688_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2734688_2733664_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2733664_2734688_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2734688_2734980_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_2735440_2741536_" > So as we layer in breath, posture, and let&#x27;s add in compassion, right?</a><a name="ts_2741536_2742860_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2742860_2748840_" > Those are all kind of recipes for restoring a sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_2749200_2755080_" > And if we put this together in a practice, a very simple one that in yoga, we call the Robin&#x27;s breath.</a><a name="ts_2755080_2764940_" > And I&#x27;ll guide this here, is with your hands on your shoulders, you inhale, you lift your spine, maybe even lift your chin, open your elbows.</a><a name="ts_2765500_2768480_" > On the exhale pattern, we find the opposite.</a><a name="ts_2768740_2770280_" > We curl inward.</a><a name="ts_2770440_2773240_" > We let our chin tuck, elbows come to touch.</a><a name="ts_2773240_2784200_" > And then we move rhythmically, finding your rhythm with breath and movement, opening and closing back in.</a><a name="ts_2784200_2788960_" > (.....)</a><a name="ts_2788960_2799280_" > Very often when we do this, we also find the areas where maybe our spine feels kind of sticky or maybe even a little bit painful.</a><a name="ts_2799280_2801408_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_2801408_2807168_" > And then you get to know what your body knows, what it&#x27;s holding on your behalf.</a><a name="ts_2807936_2817840_" > So say, for example, for me, was I go into this kind of curling forward and I feel into some of the tension that sits between my shoulder blades.</a><a name="ts_2818020_2822260_" > I might pause and just breathe right here two or three times, right?</a><a name="ts_2822420_2827620_" > Just acknowledging, oh man, it could be so tight in there sometimes.</a><a name="ts_2827620_2831400_" > Can I feel into that with some compassion?</a><a name="ts_2832180_2845760_" > And then open back up, opening the eyes, reorienting to the safe enough here and now, even as we attend to where the body houses tension or pain from the past.</a><a name="ts_2845760_2848352_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_2848352_2854190_" > And just two more breaths, your rhythm, your sensing into yourself.</a><a name="ts_2854190_2864352_" > (10 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_2864352_2865780_" > It&#x27;s good.</a><a name="ts_2866200_2867560_" > It is good, right?</a><a name="ts_2867700_2868780_" > And it&#x27;s simple.</a><a name="ts_2868780_2872000_" > It&#x27;s a practice we can do even sitting at our desks.</a><a name="ts_2872820_2873140_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2873240_2875700_" > Especially if we&#x27;ve been sitting at the computer a long time.</a><a name="ts_2875900_2877780_" > We get into good postural inefficiencies.</a><a name="ts_2878620_2879840_" > Or my favorite, this one.</a><a name="ts_2880200_2880360_" > Ooh.</a><a name="ts_2880760_2881020_" > Right.</a><a name="ts_2881580_2881880_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2881880_2883080_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_2883080_2883600_" > Absolutely.</a><a name="ts_2884060_2885880_" > We have to restore.</a><a name="ts_2886460_2894740_" > But notice, and I&#x27;m sure for our viewers too, like notice the subtle shifts from a relatively short practice.</a><a name="ts_2895160_2895800_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_2895800_2901180_" > But yeah, I felt myself becoming more aware of my heaviness and my tension back here.</a><a name="ts_2901700_2904700_" > And then as I breathed into it, I felt like laughing a little bit because I was like, oh yeah.</a><a name="ts_2904860_2907800_" > It&#x27;s like that release, like a little bit of like it softening up.</a><a name="ts_2908040_2911580_" > And it was very, I really liked that.</a><a name="ts_2911760_2912740_" > Thank you for sharing that.</a><a name="ts_2912840_2913320_" > That&#x27;s fun.</a><a name="ts_2913760_2914080_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2914300_2918240_" > So, and, and you know, of course there&#x27;s always the thinking part of my brain.</a><a name="ts_2918340_2919140_" > It&#x27;s like, am I doing this right?</a><a name="ts_2919260_2919900_" > Am I doing this right?</a><a name="ts_2920140_2920960_" > It&#x27;s like, it&#x27;s okay.</a><a name="ts_2921180_2924040_" > Just, you can be there, but just go back to just feeling it.</a><a name="ts_2924040_2928900_" > The truth is there is no right or wrong way to do these practices.</a><a name="ts_2928900_2943740_" > And I think that&#x27;s such an important element of it because the more that we get to know our bodies, the more that we allow ourselves to kind of follow sensation and feel comfortable moving towards what the body holds for us.</a><a name="ts_2943740_2956540_" > And that can take time and, you know, something, something that we were speaking about just a little bit early on, I think even before we started recording officially is just this idea of like, can we really restore a sense of safety?</a><a name="ts_2957220_2957340_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_2957620_2959420_" > Like, is that really possible?</a><a name="ts_2959720_2970320_" > And, you know, when we&#x27;re up against a lot of kind of neural neurological wiring of trauma that may be accumulated over many, many years.</a><a name="ts_2970320_2979120_" > What we need to recognize is that to restore a sense of safety as a new baseline requires routine repeated practice.</a><a name="ts_2979700_2980380_" > Yeah, right.</a><a name="ts_2980540_2995420_" > We, we, you know, when we look at the research on neuroplasticity and, you know, kind of like what helps support us to change in a positive direction and Rick Hansen has some beautiful research on this with something he calls the heel protocol.</a><a name="ts_2995420_3020500_" > He talks about how we have to counteract those negativity biases or the, the, the ways in which we are kind of, again, via survival, orienting towards what is wrong and what are the threats because we is we orient towards that it helps us prepare and keep ourselves safe and, and know what&#x27;s out there.</a><a name="ts_3020500_3030180_" > But the problem is, is that sometimes we&#x27;re so oriented to the threats or maybe historical threats, or it just becomes all that we can see.</a><a name="ts_3030380_3030820_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3030820_3047840_" > So we have to actively counteract that by looking for cues that let us know that we&#x27;re safe enough now that it&#x27;s okay right now that this is a time when I can go into myself and I can relax and restore that sense of safety.</a><a name="ts_3047840_3061420_" > And we need to repeat that every single day, right, as we&#x27;re trying to rewire something that has been orienting us vigilantly into survival states.</a><a name="ts_3061420_3081410_" > And so this heel protocol, it stands for have a positive experience, orient to that one thing, the finches on the sunflowers, the, the sweetness of another person and their, their, you know, kind of social engagement cues back of I&#x27;m with you, I&#x27;ve got this, we&#x27;ve got this together.</a><a name="ts_3081410_3097530_" > Yeah, find that one thing, have a positive experience, enrich it, get to know all the details of how your body registers that as a sense of safe, of what about that feels safe enough.</a><a name="ts_3097530_3107410_" > Right, he can be simple things like I like the color of your pink shirt, it brings me a little bit of like, Oh, wow, I&#x27;m like, I love, I love that you chose that color today.</a><a name="ts_3107610_3108770_" > And it draws me towards you.</a><a name="ts_3108890_3109910_" > I like your smile.</a><a name="ts_3110190_3117550_" > I, you know, I, I like the way that you gaze toward me in a very kind way, right?</a><a name="ts_3117550_3120370_" > So I&#x27;m like registering those details.</a><a name="ts_3120610_3130040_" > So he&#x27;ll have a positive experience, enrich it, absorb it, linger, don&#x27;t jump away from it so fast.</a><a name="ts_3130580_3140352_" > Stay there for 20 to 30 seconds with whatever this, this small, yet, yet meaningful positive shift might be.</a><a name="ts_3140352_3141568_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_3141568_3147880_" > And then the last step, heal, have a positive experience, enrich it, absorb it, stay there longer.</a><a name="ts_3148160_3162200_" > And L stands for link it, link it to that one area of challenge where you&#x27;ve been suffering, whether that&#x27;s a trauma related memory, whether it&#x27;s an ongoing struggle in your life.</a><a name="ts_3162200_3172920_" > Because what we&#x27;re doing when we&#x27;re linking is we&#x27;re basically building a new neural connection that says sometimes I&#x27;m suffering, but sometimes I feel okay.</a><a name="ts_3173888_3180610_" > Yeah, I want to know that I can move between my suffering.</a><a name="ts_3180610_3181810_" > I don&#x27;t want to ignore it.</a><a name="ts_3181910_3183630_" > I don&#x27;t want to deny it, right?</a><a name="ts_3183770_3185530_" > That would be toxic positivity, right?</a><a name="ts_3185630_3187710_" > To just focus on all this good stuff.</a><a name="ts_3187710_3188250_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3188250_3196800_" > I want to know that I can turn towards my despair, my shame, my worries, my fears, but I&#x27;m not going to get stuck there either.</a><a name="ts_3197300_3201650_" > So I can, I can link that sometimes I feel okay.</a><a name="ts_3202400_3201856_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3202400_3203720_" > Sometimes I feel connected.</a><a name="ts_3203900_3205152_" > Sometimes I feel joy.</a><a name="ts_3205728_3205152_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3206070_3209920_" > And sometimes I feel suffering and they both are part of me.</a><a name="ts_3209920_3210976_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_3210976_3213510_" > Ooh, that is so good.</a><a name="ts_3213510_3215470_" > It&#x27;s so, so profound.</a><a name="ts_3215470_3223270_" > And it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve been thinking about a lot lately is that like truly healthy people, they aren&#x27;t just calm all the time.</a><a name="ts_3223470_3225390_" > And they aren&#x27;t just happy all the time.</a><a name="ts_3225550_3227890_" > Truly healthy people do both.</a><a name="ts_3228230_3232530_" > Like they hold, they can hold both sadness and joy in the same day.</a><a name="ts_3232910_3233390_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_3233390_3238290_" > Where someone, someone who maybe gets stuck would be like, well, I had this happen to me on my drive.</a><a name="ts_3238490_3239930_" > So today&#x27;s going to be a terrible day.</a><a name="ts_3239930_3244290_" > And then they, they scan for the bad and then they pay attention to the bad.</a><a name="ts_3244570_3250490_" > I had someone tell me the other day, I have this theory that all my even years are good and all my odd years are bad.</a><a name="ts_3250650_3252510_" > Like bad things happen in my even years.</a><a name="ts_3252710_3254970_" > And I was like, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy.</a><a name="ts_3255870_3261030_" > In all the even years, you&#x27;re just looking and scanning for all the bad that happens.</a><a name="ts_3261250_3265970_" > And truthfully, like an even year probably has some bad and probably has some good.</a><a name="ts_3265970_3266950_" > That&#x27;s right.</a><a name="ts_3267430_3270410_" > And an odd year probably has good and bad.</a><a name="ts_3270830_3272590_" > And so I love this idea of linking.</a><a name="ts_3272590_3274784_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3274784_3276670_" > Maybe I can give an example from my day today.</a><a name="ts_3276950_3281150_" > Like I definitely have an old story that&#x27;s like never good enough.</a><a name="ts_3281310_3281950_" > Gotta be better.</a><a name="ts_3282090_3282570_" > Gotta be better.</a><a name="ts_3282670_3285830_" > Like just this

a parent.</a><a name="ts_3291390_3292410_" > It is not possible.</a><a name="ts_3292770_3293610_" > Like I mess up.</a><a name="ts_3293710_3295150_" > People are like, you must be such a good

kids never want a relationship with me and these like catastrophizing thoughts?</a><a name="ts_3347230_3354530_" > And if I compare that with like, we just, we try to have little beautiful moments

betrayals and relational wounds.</a><a name="ts_3375980_3378260_" > I just want to say this again and again.</a><a name="ts_3378500_3380680_" > We, we don&#x27;t heal alone, right?</a><a name="ts_3380680_3383180_" > We need relational sources of safety.</a><a name="ts_3383180_3387480_" > And that&#x27;s where, you know, gratefully we, we have those in our world, right?</a><a name="ts_3387660_3391060_" > Whether that&#x27;s through psychotherapy or I love group work.</a><a name="ts_3391200_3392600_" > I love running.</a><a name="ts_3392720_3394100_" > I run vagal toning groups.</a><a name="ts_3394100_3397340_" > Um, I run, uh, vagus nerve yoga classes.</a><a name="ts_3397400_3404760_" > I love these opportunities that we have to come together with other people who are like-minded,</a><a name="ts_3404800_3421780_" > who are on the healing path, where we get to show up as we are and, um, be welcomed in whether that&#x27;s one-on-one spaces or community spaces, um, that reduces the isolation and aloneness of, of the kinds of suffering.</a><a name="ts_3421780_3432060_" > But the, you know, the research I&#x27;ve spent so many years researching how we change and why we change and the research shows that it&#x27;s the commitment to the things that make a difference.</a><a name="ts_3432060_3441840_" > And that, you know, I often like in trauma recovery and the practices that support it to the practices that we need to do every day, like brush our teeth, right?</a><a name="ts_3441980_3449260_" > Like if I found a practice that helped me feel good on Monday and I think that that&#x27;s good enough for the week, it&#x27;s probably not, right?</a><a name="ts_3449260_3453340_" > Like, you know, we can brush our teeth multiple times a day, right?</a><a name="ts_3453580_3453600_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3453720_3464460_" > So like engaging in practices that are shifting your nervous system, even if that dial is moving super slow, um, that are going to shift you in that positive direction.</a><a name="ts_3464460_3475200_" > And speaking of slow transition, when we think about the shift from, you know, the summer solstice to the winter solstice or the winter solstice to the summer, right?</a><a name="ts_3475520_3475660_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3475940_3491540_" > It&#x27;s super subtle changes that we don&#x27;t really notice on a day to day basis, but that each of those 10 minute increments of the change in the sun and its arc on the horizon dramatically changes a season.</a><a name="ts_3491540_3492060_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_3492480_3493020_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3493020_3503000_" > So we have those seasons inside of us and we just have to remember that it&#x27;s the small incremental shifts that ultimately accumulate and build on each other.</a><a name="ts_3503520_3505770_" > I love that.</a><a name="ts_3506050_3506250_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3506470_3516000_" > The sun, the sun, the length of day changes by 60 to 90 seconds a day and it changes it from winter to summer.</a><a name="ts_3516280_3516840_" > It&#x27;s cool.</a><a name="ts_3517792_3518350_" > Tiny changes.</a><a name="ts_3518350_3519648_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_3519648_3532320_" > When I, when I first learned about polyvagal, my trainer recommended, um, to like try to notice and just touch base with your nervous system multiple times an hour.</a><a name="ts_3533056_3534048_" > What do you think about that?</a><a name="ts_3534688_3537280_" > Oh, I think it&#x27;s great when we can remember to do those things.</a><a name="ts_3537460_3539540_" > I mean, how many of us remember to do those things?</a><a name="ts_3539980_3548580_" > I said, yeah, I use like a timer, literally when I&#x27;m rewiring something, I use a timer to remind myself multiple times an hour.</a><a name="ts_3548580_3549160_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3549340_3549420_" > Same.</a><a name="ts_3549580_3553940_" > I think it&#x27;s really, really profound to use, uh, use our technologies.</a><a name="ts_3554640_3556900_" > Um, don&#x27;t I have a fun little thing on the back of here?</a><a name="ts_3557000_3558560_" > It&#x27;s my little pop socket, but it&#x27;s cute.</a><a name="ts_3558840_3559280_" > Cute.</a><a name="ts_3559280_3560540_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_3560540_3565380_" > Anyhow, we use our technologies to support us to grow.</a><a name="ts_3565580_3569040_" > And I think that like, there&#x27;s nothing wrong with using these little crutches.</a><a name="ts_3569040_3573100_" > I prefer the little, I have sweet timers like chimes that go off.</a><a name="ts_3573500_3573540_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3573540_3581440_" > Versus the rubber band technique that we learned way back in the day before we had smartphones that basically, basically said like every time you have a negative thought snap.</a><a name="ts_3581780_3582200_" > Whap yourself.</a><a name="ts_3582200_3584280_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_3584280_3586420_" > Well, that doesn&#x27;t feel like it supports my growth.</a><a name="ts_3586780_3590340_" > The gentle chimes that says, are you breathing right now?</a><a name="ts_3590620_3590680_" > Yeah.</a><a name="ts_3590820_3593200_" > Or take a two minute breathe break, right?</a><a name="ts_3593460_3595680_" > Like, oh, I can do that.</a><a name="ts_3596440_3596760_" > Right?</a><a name="ts_3597100_3604100_" > And so I think, you know, I think again, like we can look for what supports us to do the practices.</a><a name="ts_3604100_3610600_" > I think that&#x27;s one of the biggest barriers out there is that we know what we should be doing, but we don&#x27;t do it.</a><a name="ts_3611300_3615160_" > Um, I actually want to shamelessly plug something that goes along with the book.</a><a name="ts_3615340_3618340_" > So the, the, um, polyvagal theory workbook for trauma.</a><a name="ts_3618800_3623770_" > One of the things that I&#x27;m really proud of is that I, um, thank you.</a><a name="ts_3624170_3633590_" > I, um, collaborated with new harbinger, the publisher of the book, and we created a course that accompanies the book.</a><a name="ts_3633590_3637210_" > And the course is less than the cost of a single therapy session.</a><a name="ts_3637430_3639110_" > It&#x27;s, it&#x27;s less than a hundred dollars.</a><a name="ts_3639370_3645870_" > And it basically is me on video guiding you through every practice in the book.</a><a name="ts_3646250_3648830_" > And it, it&#x27;s a lifetime access.</a><a name="ts_3649150_3663170_" > And so it&#x27;s one of those kind of really deep, um, passions for me, which is to increase accessibility because we all know that psychotherapy is expensive and that sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find that person.</a><a name="ts_3663170_3664930_" > And, and so on and so forth.</a><a name="ts_3665070_3674490_" > And so, you know, kind of like you, I think that shared mission of how do we increase accessibility to trauma informed skills and, and therapy awareness skills.</a><a name="ts_3674890_3677710_" > Um, it&#x27;s, it&#x27;s one of those tools that are out there.</a><a name="ts_3677910_3679170_" > Oh, that&#x27;s so good.</a><a name="ts_3679230_3680810_" > The course is called let your body hold you.</a><a name="ts_3681090_3682048_" > Let your body hold you.</a><a name="ts_3682624_3682860_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_3683040_3684140_" > And where can people find you?</a><a name="ts_3684220_3685140_" > I&#x27;m so glad you plugged that.</a><a name="ts_3685240_3687220_" > And where can people find you, your books?</a><a name="ts_3687420_3688100_" > Do you have a website?</a><a name="ts_3688300_3688640_" > What is it?</a><a name="ts_3689184_3688640_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_3689550_3689710_" > All right.</a><a name="ts_3689830_3690850_" > I have two websites.</a><a name="ts_3691190_3693870_" > One is simply drarielschwartz.com.</a><a name="ts_3694050_3697810_" > So it&#x27;s pretty easy to find me dr drarielschwartz.com.</a><a name="ts_3697990_3702730_" > The other is resilience informed therapies.com resilience informed therapy.com.</a><a name="ts_3702730_3714670_" > And that one is basically a hub for all of the kind of people that have trained with me or like minded clinicians that are offering some similar types of work out there.</a><a name="ts_3715190_3720330_" > Um, I would say sign up for my newsletter, which you can do from either of those websites.</a><a name="ts_3720350_3724010_" > It&#x27;s the same newsletter to get to know what are the courses that I&#x27;m offering.</a><a name="ts_3724010_3728590_" > Some of which are for therapists on how to, uh, treat trauma and complex PTSD.</a><a name="ts_3728850_3730150_" > Some are for lay person.</a><a name="ts_3730370_3735090_" > I offer retreats, um, called the beyond trauma retreat and vagal toning retreats.</a><a name="ts_3735090_3743630_" > And, um, I have a YouTube channel under drarielschwartz where you&#x27;ll find, uh, again, lots of, uh, free resources on trauma recovery.</a><a name="ts_3743750_3748090_" > Um, on Instagram, I am arielschwartzboulder and YouTube drarielschwartz.</a><a name="ts_3748810_3750190_" > So lots of ways to find me.</a><a name="ts_3750370_3751230_" > That&#x27;s so great.</a><a

name="ts_3756390_3758150_" > And, um, it has just been a delight.</a><a name="ts_3758290_3761750_" > Thank you so much for your time, your wisdom, your years of experience.</a><a name="ts_3761910_3763008_" > Really appreciate you coming on.</a><a name="ts_3763008_3765824_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_3765824_3770700_" > If you found anything in this video helpful, I would really appreciate it if you could give it a thumbs up</a><a name="ts_3770700_3773480_" > or share it with someone who could benefit from it today.</a></p></div></body>
