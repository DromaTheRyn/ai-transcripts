right now.</a><a name="ts_491360_500032_" > Your subconscious sense that emotions are to be avoided may be kicking in right now, creating an aversion to trying any of this out.</a><a name="ts_500960_509312_" > Your conscious mind might be looking for rationalizations for this subconscious feeling like, who has the time to do all of that?</a><a name="ts_509312_510848_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_510848_518048_" > The thing is, some things are worth the time and effort and your emotions, wellbeing, and relationships to your loved ones certainly are.</a><a name="ts_519040_527120_" > Also, the more you practice these skills, the more they&#x27;ll come naturally to you and it takes less intentional effort.</a><a name="ts_527120_530080_" > The better you get at feeling, the easier it gets.</a><a name="ts_530080_531360_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_531360_540608_" > Another thing to consider is, being detached from feelings will cost you a lot more time and effort further along the road,</a><a name="ts_541280_545940_" > because you&#x27;ll have to deal with all the problems that creates, which can be very substantial.</a><a name="ts_545940_548032_" > (..)</a><a
