But for many people with trauma, the traumatic memories flood that thinking</a><a name="ts_138240_143480_" > part of the brain, the prefrontal cortex, the front part of the brain, and physically prevent the brain</a><a name="ts_143480_149120_" > from processing through trauma with talk therapy. Now fortunately there&#x27;s a way to target the problem</a><a name="ts_149120_154560_" > of flashbacks and the negative messaging we internalized by using the tool of visualization,</a><a name="ts_154560_159300_" > which is going to help you process trauma. And visualization has just four steps.</a><a name="ts_159300_164280_" > Instead of talking about the traumatic event repeatedly, we&#x27;re going to explore how the trauma</a><a name="ts_164280_171280_" > is impacting us right here in the present moment. So the first step of this intervention is to explore</a><a name="ts_171280_177220_" > the beliefs you&#x27;ve adopted because of trauma. How has trauma impacted how you see yourself? How has it</a><a name="ts_177220_183140_" > changed your identity? Many of my clients believe something like this. I&#x27;m unlovable. I don&#x27;t deserve to be</a><a name="ts_183140_188440_" > treated well. I&#x27;m broken. It&#x27;s all my fault. If people really knew what I did, they would hate me.</a><a name="ts_188440_194520_" > I have to hide my true self. I should have known better. I always make terrible choices. I&#x27;m a</a><a name="ts_194520_200560_" > terrible human being. Or I can&#x27;t trust anyone. So for this exercise we&#x27;re going to start by writing down</a><a name="ts_200560_207140_" > your I am dot dot dot statements. These are the self-limiting beliefs that keep you stuck in trauma</a><a name="ts_207140_212440_" > here in the present moment long after the danger has passed. When we believe them, our body reverts to</a><a name="ts_212440_217140_" > that fight-flight-freeze mode. We hide away in our shell. Your traumatic experience may have sent you the</a><a name="ts_217140_223660_" > message in all caps. You are powerless. You are worthless. You can&#x27;t trust anyone. And somehow</a><a name="ts_223660_228840_" > we started to believe it without even realizing the trauma is a liar. And when we started believing it,</a><a name="ts_228900_233460_" > we started acting like it. So if you believe that you&#x27;re worthless, you settle for bad relationships.</a><a name="ts_233500_237960_" > If you believe that you&#x27;re powerless, you give up on your dreams. And these are the behaviors that keep</a><a name="ts_237960_242680_" > fueling trauma in your life. Because you believe that you&#x27;re worthless, your new partner mistreats you.</a><a name="ts_242680_246740_" > Because you believe you&#x27;ll fail at starting a business, you end up working for the man and you</a><a name="ts_246740_251720_" > continue to feel powerless and resentful. So these trauma-fueled beliefs keep getting reinforced</a><a name="ts_251720_258000_" > because we keep reliving them in our heads and in our actions. So instead of talking about trauma and</a><a name="ts_258000_263600_" > giving energy to these self-limiting beliefs, we&#x27;re going to use the power of visualization to flip the script.</a><a name="ts_263760_267900_" > Okay, so now for step two, we&#x27;re going to write what the healed version of yourself</a><a name="ts_267900_275400_" > would say when he says, I am dot dot dot. So for example, if your trauma belief is I&#x27;m worthless,</a><a name="ts_275400_281640_" > I&#x27;ll never find true love, the new belief would be I am totally lovable. I deserve to be treated with</a><a name="ts_281640_287460_" > respect and love. Someone out there is going to show me this love and I won&#x27;t settle for less. If your</a><a name="ts_287460_294260_" > belief was I am powerless, the new belief is I can directly influence my success. I can learn the skills</a><a name="ts_294260_299560_" > to be awesome at life. I can build a successful business. And eventually you&#x27;re going to replace</a><a name="ts_299560_304940_" > each trauma-fueled belief with a new healthier belief. But for now, we&#x27;re just going to focus on</a><a name="ts_304940_310080_" > one. When you start using these healthy beliefs, you may need to refer back to your list to remember</a><a name="ts_310080_315980_" > what words you&#x27;re using to counteract those trauma-fueled beliefs. And eventually you&#x27;ll remember</a><a name="ts_315980_320860_" > them as they&#x27;re needed in the moment, but it&#x27;s a good idea to have a list of positive phrases on your</a><a name="ts_320860_325160_" > bathroom mirror or on your phone home screen, somewhere that you&#x27;re going to see regularly</a><a name="ts_325160_330340_" > during the day. These words are your new story and they can be powerful. So just think, like,</a><a name="ts_330480_336160_" > how would your actions change if you believed your new story? And that&#x27;s the third step. Get out your</a><a name="ts_336160_342900_" > journal and visualize in incredible detail what your day looks like when you fully believe each statement.</a><a name="ts_343100_348360_" > Write it in the present tense and imagine the small details as you live your life</a><a name="ts_348360_354180_" > filled with safety and connection and love. What would your day look like? What would flow more</a><a name="ts_354180_360220_" > smoothly? And why is this the life that you&#x27;ve chosen? How does it stay true to the kind of life</a><a name="ts_360220_365500_" > that&#x27;s rich and meaningful to you? And then you could even create some kind of visual representation</a><a name="ts_365500_369580_" > of this new belief. Okay, I&#x27;m going to share a much longer example of how to do this at the end of</a><a name="ts_369580_375240_" > the video, but let me share a non-trauma example from my editor of how she uses visualization for the</a><a name="ts_375240_381070_" > novel that she&#x27;s writing. She says this. Tell us about your vision board. Okay, so I have a vision</a><a name="ts_381070_388420_" > board that I use to just bring things into my life and one of the things I&#x27;m working on is a novel.</a><a name="ts_388860_394930_" > So I&#x27;ll show you the way that I use this. I wrote up this little description of what my novel is going</a><a name="ts_394930_401470_" > to be like and it&#x27;s super specific, like what size the book is going to be and what the cover is going to</a><a name="ts_401470_408200_" > look like and it will be embossed. And then I also wrote my feelings about how it&#x27;s going to feel</a><a name="ts_408940_415320_" > when it&#x27;s written and people are thanking me for the experience of reading this book. So, and then I have</a><a name="ts_415320_421940_" > the picture. So I come up here every morning and I stand about three feet away from my vision board</a><a name="ts_422540_426950_" > and I set my phone timer and I just, I start by kind of grounding myself,</a><a name="ts_427870_434700_" > getting like a strong stance and then I look at it and I set my timer for a minute and I read through</a><a name="ts_434700_441130_" > it and then I close my eyes and I imagine holding it and smelling it and flipping through the pages</a><a name="ts_442030_447110_" > and going through all those emotions. But those emotions of gratitude and joy are going to feel like</a><a name="ts_447110_454160_" > when this comes to pass. I love it. And that&#x27;s it. Would you read it? Sure. Read it so we know what it says?</a><a name="ts_454160_460928_" > Yes. So my vision is to publish Kovalo Summer as a bestseller. That&#x27;s the name of the book.</a><a name="ts_461632_468270_" > By December 2025 Kovalo Summer will be in print. The paperback copy will be just under 400 pages</a><a name="ts_468890_474410_" > plus sections with historical notes and discussion points. The novel will be about five and a half inches</a><a name="ts_474410_481800_" > wide and eight and one quarter inches tall and one inch thick. The title will be embossed and I always</a><a name="ts_481800_488440_" > like feel the title. The cover will have a hilly landscape with oaks, a broad sky and two figures</a><a name="ts_488440_495100_" > on horseback. It will be thrilling to see this story as a printed book, to smell its pages and to sign</a><a name="ts_495100_501770_" > copies for readers. I do that too. I&#x27;ll practice signing the copies. This book will spread hope for</a><a name="ts_501770_508770_" > those seeking open, non-judgmental love in family situations that aren&#x27;t their idea of ideal. It will</a><a name="ts_508770_514850_" > spread compassion. My heart will swell with light when readers tell me how this book affects them</a><a name="ts_514850_521760_" > and even how it changes their lives. Readers will chuckle and cry as they read the story. So there you</a><a name="ts_521760_526840_" > go. I love it. And you do that for one minute. One minute every day. Every day. Yeah. And sometimes</a><a name="ts_526840_534930_" > thoughts will come to me during the day, like for any of these, like a next step I need to take. But usually it&#x27;s</a><a name="ts_534930_541190_" > just looking at it and going through the words. Yeah. Yeah. That&#x27;s so cool. Would you be comfortable?</a><a name="ts_541270_549730_" > We can stop there. But, um, would you be comfortable telling about the truck? Sure. Okay. Yeah. Well,</a><a name="ts_549810_554330_" > actually. You want to tell about that one? This one&#x27;s kind of amazing, actually. Okay. Tell us about</a><a name="ts_554330_560750_" > that one. I can tell you about both. Mary has, Mary&#x27;s visualizations have come to pass multiple times.</a><a name="ts_560750_568350_" > Yeah. My, so I set a date and I find that I&#x27;m usually way off on the timing. Yeah.</a><a name="ts_568670_577070_" > Which is true for this one. So about a year ago, I set this desire that I wanted, my husband runs a</a><a name="ts_577070_583760_" > non-profit and I. A non-profit that supports orphanages throughout the world. Right. Yeah. And not even,</a><a name="ts_583940_592750_" > we&#x27;re kind of women beyond that to help kids in all sorts of vulnerable situations. Anyway, um, so what I put</a><a name="ts_592750_599390_" > out there was that they would get a million dollars of unrestricted donations so they could use it</a><a name="ts_599390_606030_" > however they needed to. And like, um, I listed specifically that they&#x27;d be able to pay their</a><a name="ts_606030_611870_" > people, that my husband would stop being stressed about the money situation, which is always a problem</a><a name="ts_611870_620650_" > for non-profit directors. And I talked about how the excitement that would build would, um, draw other</a><a name="ts_620650_624640_" > people to the organization and other donors and people who can help with their mission.</a><a name="ts_625216_635710_" > So I put it as March 31st of last year in September or October of 2024, a donor came forward and said,</a><a name="ts_635890_640110_" > he had been on a trip with us a few years ago. And I was about all the interaction we had had.</a><a name="ts_640350_645470_" > And he said, I&#x27;m selling my business this year and my wife and I want to donate $1 million to you guys,</a><a name="ts_645470_656960_" > and you can use it however you want to. Um, yeah. So the first half million came in right</a><a name="ts_656960_660320_" > before the end of the year and the second half million is supposed to come this week. So.</a><a name="ts_660760_665240_" > Okay. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s still here. I haven&#x27;t taken it down until that second half million comes.</a><a name="ts_665420_671010_" > So cool. But yeah, it&#x27;s crazy because I can put a million dollars out there.</a><a name="ts_671910_677472_" > Oh, and, um, what was interesting about this one, like, I&#x27;d often look at this and think,</a><a name="ts_678080_685536_" > what can I do to further this? And I had the thought, probably in June or July,</a><a name="ts_686080_689792_" > just keep working on their annual report. I write their annual report every year.</a><a name="ts_690720_695050_" > I&#x27;m like, okay, I&#x27;ll do my little annual report part. The donor that came forward said,</a><a name="ts_695840_699010_" > when he found out they were going to sell their business, he&#x27;s like, I got your annual report.</a><a name="ts_699010_703240_" > I read through it. I&#x27;m super excited about what you guys are talking about.</a><a name="ts_703280_705200_" > I was like, I had a piece. That&#x27;s so cool.</a><a name="ts_705300_708880_" > So yeah. I love it. This kind of stuff happens all the time. It&#x27;s really cool.</a><a name="ts_709020_711300_" > It&#x27;s not the first time. Oh no. Yeah.</a><a name="ts_711860_715380_" > And that&#x27;s the other part of the practice. When one of these comes to pass,</a><a name="ts_715600_720740_" > I take it down, I journal about it, like all the pieces that came together to make it happen.</a><a name="ts_720840_721120_" > Oh yeah.</a><a name="ts_721420_724380_" > And then I keep it in a binder. So it&#x27;s kind of like my gratitude binder</a><a name="ts_725340_726920_" > of stuff coming to pass.</a><a name="ts_727680_728900_" > So how thick is this binder?</a><a name="ts_729680_732490_" > It probably has about 20 things in it.</a><a name="ts_732750_735770_" > Holy cow. Including a truck that was donated to your orphanage.</a><a name="ts_735830_736650_" > It was on your vision board.</a><a name="ts_736790_737010_" > Yes.</a><a name="ts_737170_737830_" > And it got donated.</a><a name="ts_737990_738870_" > Do you want me to explain that?</a><a name="ts_738970_740870_" > Sure. Tell the story. These are such good stories.</a><a name="ts_740870_742110_" > Yes. Me too.</a><a name="ts_742630_749050_" > The very first thing I put on the vision board was we had an employee down in Mexico.</a><a name="ts_749250_750150_" > He&#x27;s Mexican.</a><a name="ts_750650_753550_" > And his job was to go to the orphanages and help with maintenance.</a><a name="ts_753550_758690_" > maintenance. And yeah, so the orphanage directors didn&#x27;t have to worry about maintenance.</a><a name="ts_759230_764510_" > And his truck broke down. And so he was having a really hard time figuring out transportation.</a><a name="ts_765110_768768_" > And he&#x27;s like, I might have to quit this job because I can&#x27;t deliver on it.</a><a name="ts_768768_769920_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_769920_774660_" > But the home still needed his help. And so I put on the board, a truck for Alejandro.</a><a name="ts_775600_778900_" > I don&#x27;t know how I was going to get it, but just a truck.</a><a name="ts_779380_785540_" > And like a month later, a dealership here in Utah was like, hey, we want to donate a vehicle to your</a><a name="ts_785540_787900_" > organization. Do you need a truck?</a><a name="ts_788340_789240_" > That&#x27;s so cool.</a><a name="ts_789240_791760_" > So we took the truck and drove it down to Alejandro. Yeah.</a><a name="ts_792340_793000_" > Oh my gosh.</a><a name="ts_793000_793520_" > I love it.</a><a name="ts_793620_794260_" > Such a great example.</a><a name="ts_794360_794660_" > Thank you.</a><a name="ts_794740_795240_" > Thank you for sharing.</a><a name="ts_795360_795600_" > You&#x27;re welcome.</a><a name="ts_796200_796580_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_796660_802000_" > I love Mary&#x27;s example of how she uses visualization to accomplish her goals.</a><a name="ts_802100_805400_" > And she has some pretty cool stories about the things she has accomplished,</a><a name="ts_805400_809740_" > thanks to her visualizing, including helping an orphanage in Mexico</a><a name="ts_809740_812740_" > be gifted a truck from a dealership in Utah.</a><a name="ts_812740_814260_" > So that&#x27;s pretty exciting.</a><a name="ts_814540_814900_" > Okay.</a><a name="ts_815080_816300_" > And I use visualization.</a><a name="ts_816320_821640_" > I get on Canva, which is like a free graphic design website, and I get on Canva and I make</a><a name="ts_821640_824860_" > vision boards each year where I create a vision of what I want my year to be like.</a><a name="ts_824940_828080_" > And I just pull pictures from my phone, pop it in there, add some positive phrases.</a><a name="ts_828320_829940_" > Maybe I&#x27;ll make a longer video about that.</a><a name="ts_830020_833900_" > But in some way, we&#x27;re going to be activating the visual cortex in your brain when we do this.</a><a name="ts_834040_838560_" > So having a visual picture in your mind or a physical visual picture of what this is going</a><a name="ts_838560_840640_" > to look like is pretty important to this exercise.</a><a name="ts_840640_842180_" > Okay, so then number four.</a><a name="ts_842340_846480_" > Each morning as you wake up and or each night before drifting off to sleep,</a><a name="ts_846740_850860_" > spend like three minutes visualizing yourself fully living that new life.</a><a name="ts_850980_854280_" > You could read it to yourself or you could listen to a recording of it.</a><a name="ts_854340_856200_" > Like you can record yourself in your voice memos,</a><a name="ts_856480_859180_" > reading through your visualization and listen to that each night.</a><a name="ts_859240_863340_" > And as you read it or listen to it, you&#x27;re going to picture yourself</a><a name="ts_863340_868640_" > stepping through a door into this fresh chapter, leaving your old identity behind.</a><a name="ts_868640_873380_" > You&#x27;re going to immerse yourself in the details and you&#x27;re going to see it and feel it and experience</a><a name="ts_873380_875500_" > it as if it&#x27;s already real.</a><a name="ts_875700_878980_" > Now here&#x27;s where things get really fascinating from a neurological perspective.</a><a name="ts_879080_882840_" > When you visualize this new life, two big things happen.</a><a name="ts_883020_886120_" > Number one, your brain physically experiences your vision.</a><a name="ts_886120_891680_" > So your body physiologically changes to a sympathetic state in your nervous system,</a><a name="ts_891840_893340_" > feeling safe, confident, and relaxed.</a><a name="ts_893340_898260_" > And then this rewires your nervous system to be sympathetically dominant.</a><a name="ts_898260_903660_" > And what that means is it&#x27;s more likely to default to a sense of safety or self-control</a><a name="ts_903660_905520_" > instead of the fight, flight, freeze response.</a><a name="ts_905740_911320_" > The second thing that this does is it&#x27;s like physically practicing these new behaviors.</a><a name="ts_911540_912880_" > Athletes do this all the time.</a><a name="ts_913060_920200_" > It helps them perform successfully and visualization can help you retrain your reflexive response to situations</a><a name="ts_920200_922860_" > to be safe and successful and calm.</a><a name="ts_923020_926900_" > By rewriting your trauma story, you rewire your brain to heal from trauma.</a><a name="ts_926900_931640_" > So if this resonates with you, I&#x27;m going to challenge you to try these four steps this week.</a><a name="ts_931760_936600_" > Grab a journal, spend three to five minutes each morning visualizing your healed self.</a><a name="ts_936780_941680_" > You really can build a life where you feel safe, confident, worthy of love, and empowered.</a><a name="ts_941880_944620_" > And these new beliefs invite the best out of others too.</a><a name="ts_944620_948160_" > They&#x27;re going to treat you with more respect, conversations are going to go more smoothly,</a><a name="ts_948580_952360_" > problems are going to get solved more peacefully, and you&#x27;re going to start to see more success in</a><a name="ts_952360_956120_" > your life.

Here we go. Close your eyes and take a deep</a><a name="ts_1009000_1014500_" > breath. Imagine you&#x27;re standing in front of a full-length mirror. The reflection looking back at you</a><a name="ts_1014500_1020190_" > is confident and self-assured. You see yourself as someone who&#x27;s deeply worthy of love and respect.</a><a name="ts_1020190_1028070_" > This belief is etched into every fiber of your being. As you gaze into your reflection, you feel</a><a name="ts_1028070_1035590_" > quiet, unshakable strength. Now picture yourself stepping into a world of dating. How does this</a><a name="ts_1035590_1042510_" > belief show up in your actions and choices? Visualize yourself sitting in a cozy cafe, sunlight streaming</a><a name="ts_1042510_1048550_" > through the windows. You&#x27;re relaxed. You&#x27;re genuinely enjoying the moment. The person across from you seems nice,</a><a name="ts_1048590_1053350_" > but you&#x27;re not desperate to impress them. You&#x27;re simply yourself. You&#x27;re authentic. You&#x27;re kind.</a><a name="ts_1053350_1060470_" > You&#x27;re unapologetically real. You listen attentively, but you also share your own thoughts and your own</a><a name="ts_1060470_1066710_" > stories, and you aren&#x27;t afraid to express what excites you or what you&#x27;re looking for. You know,</a><a name="ts_1066710_1071830_" > you feel confident that if this connection doesn&#x27;t work out, it doesn&#x27;t diminish your worth. You leave</a><a name="ts_1071830_1078760_" > the date feeling good, not because of their reaction, but because you stayed true to yourself. Now imagine</a><a name="ts_1078760_1084560_" > this. Imagine receiving a text that doesn&#x27;t sit well with you. Maybe it&#x27;s dismissive or disrespectful,</a><a name="ts_1084560_1091290_" > or it&#x27;s just off. Instead of brushing it aside or overanalyzing it, you respond with grace and</a><a name="ts_1091290_1097088_" > clarity. You might say, oh hey, I value communication that&#x27;s respectful and consistent. Is everything okay?</a><a name="ts_1097824_1103610_" > If the behavior persists, you calmly decide to step away. You don&#x27;t feel the need to chase, explain,</a><a name="ts_1103610_1110930_" > or fix things. You trust that the right person will naturally align with your standards. Picture yourself</a><a name="ts_1110930_1116370_" > being asked out by someone who seems nice, but doesn&#x27;t match the qualities you&#x27;re seeking in a</a><a name="ts_1116370_1122940_" > partner. You thank them kindly, and you let them know that it&#x27;s not the right fit for you. There&#x27;s no guilt,</a><a name="ts_1122940_1130590_" > there&#x27;s no second guessing. You&#x27;ve learned that being assertive is okay, that setting boundaries is</a><a name="ts_1130590_1137670_" > totally okay. You&#x27;ve let go of the need to please everyone or settle for good enough. Instead, you&#x27;re holding</a><a name="ts_1137670_1143950_" > space for the kind of love that feels reciprocal and fulfilling. Now finally, imagine being in a</a><a name="ts_1143950_1147950_" > relationship where you notice red flags or incompatibilities. Instead of staying in that</a><a name="ts_1147950_1154912_" > relationship out of fear or hoping that they&#x27;ll change or trying to change them, you lovingly let go.</a><a name="ts_1155840_1160710_" > You might say, hmm, I value what we&#x27;ve shared, but I don&#x27;t feel this is the right fit for me. And you leave</a><a name="ts_1160710_1166030_" > that relationship with dignity, knowing you leave the relationship with dignity, knowing that walking away</a><a name="ts_1166030_1172896_" > creates space for something better. Now imagine meeting someone who truly sees you for who you are.</a><a name="ts_1173664_1178260_" > They show up with curiosity, respect, and enthusiasm. They take time to understand your values and what</a><a name="ts_1178260_1183220_" > makes you happy. Their actions line up with their words. They follow through on promises, and they make</a><a name="ts_1183220_1189030_" > an effort to build a connection. You feel at ease because you don&#x27;t have to question their intentions.</a><a name="ts_1189310_1195488_" > You&#x27;re attracted to this person by standing firmly in your worth, and they meet you there with mutual respect.</a><a name="ts_1195488_1196672_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_1196672_1204890_" > You are living day to day in a way that you don&#x27;t settle for less. You wait for and expect to be</a><a name="ts_1204890_1210730_" > treated with respect in all of your interactions with work, at home, and in your relationships.</a><a name="ts_1210890_1217510_" > You communicate clearly. You own your own responsibilities, and you allow other people to be responsible for</a><a name="ts_1217510_1224320_" > theirs, and you feel perfectly comfortable saying no when someone crosses your boundaries and walking away.</a><a name="ts_1224320_1230140_" > And because of that, you&#x27;ve built up such healthy relationships that you find someone who treats</a><a name="ts_1230140_1237340_" > you with love and respect. Now as you step back from this visualization, notice how living from this</a><a name="ts_1237340_1242400_" > belief transforms your dating life. You aren&#x27;t driven by scarcity or fear. You trust that love and respect</a><a name="ts_1242400_1247700_" > are abundant, and you&#x27;ll find a connection that reflects your inner worth. Okay, take a deep breath and</a><a name="ts_1247700_1254176_" > remind yourself, I am worthy of love and respect, and I won&#x27;t settle for less. When you open your eyes,</a><a name="ts_1254976_1262130_" > carry this energy with you. Okay, so that&#x27;s an example of how you can visualize creating a healthy</a><a name="ts_1262130_1267470_" > dating life to build and find a really healthy relationship in the future. Okay, hope you found</a><a name="ts_1267470_1272790_" > that helpful. Thank you for watching and take care.
