It will fundamentally</a><a name="ts_6210_12530_" > transform how you interact with painful thoughts and emotions and relationships. You&#x27;ll practice</a><a name="ts_12530_16610_" > creating space for them so that you can be less reactive and more intentional in your actions.</a><a name="ts_16710_23490_" > It&#x27;s a powerful, transformative exercise. And at the same time, it&#x27;s not difficult to practice. It&#x27;s a</a><a name="ts_23490_30160_" > simple skill, and I&#x27;ve invited mindfulness expert Thomas McConkie to join us to teach it. As this</a><a name="ts_30160_36020_" > exercise is designed to work with disturbances or uncomfortable emotions, it&#x27;s going to be a little</a><a name="ts_36020_41200_" > uncomfortable. But if you find yourself getting overwhelmed, feel free to take a break, do something</a><a name="ts_41200_47240_" > comforting, and then come back to this exercise when you feel more resourced or safe. This exercise</a><a name="ts_47240_52540_" > is about 12 minutes, and I&#x27;ve made a longer version of this video where I debrief and explore my</a><a name="ts_52540_59040_" > experience with Thomas because each time I do this exercise, something inside of me changes. But the</a><a name="ts_59040_64820_" > first couple times, it was pretty mind-blowing for me. So if you struggle or feel confused during the</a><a name="ts_64820_72170_" > exercise, definitely check out the longer version of the video to explore the why. Okay, without further</a><a name="ts_72170_84340_" > ado, let&#x27;s jump in. One of the things I&#x27;ve noticed is that for a lot of people, they have a hard time</a><a name="ts_84340_91380_" > feeling their feelings. Like, they don&#x27;t know what it means to feel their feelings, and that could include</a><a name="ts_91380_95640_" > their emotions. Like, they don&#x27;t quite know what it means to feel what their emotions are saying. But</a><a name="ts_95640_103240_" > they also don&#x27;t know how to sit with their body&#x27;s sensations and what&#x27;s going on there. And I think a lot</a><a name="ts_103240_111580_" > of people have a tendency to distract themselves or avoid having these feelings, whether they&#x27;re emotional or</a><a name="ts_111580_123640_" > physical or they maybe suppress them, or they intellectualize or distract themselves mentally</a><a name="ts_123640_130460_" > so that they don&#x27;t have to sit with them. And that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m hoping that you can talk with us</a><a name="ts_130460_136770_" > about today, Thomas. I&#x27;m excited to talk about this today. I&#x27;m happy to. I love the introduction.</a><a name="ts_136770_138710_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_138710_144030_" > It needs no embellishment. But if I were to add anything, I would just say from a Buddhist perspective,</a><a name="ts_144370_150670_" > that yes, we all do that as human beings. We avoid ourselves. We are in conflict with reality,</a><a name="ts_150910_156630_" > meaning, like, what is true right now? What&#x27;s the truth of our embodied experience? We&#x27;re often in</a><a name="ts_156630_162070_" > conflict with that and that causes profound suffering. So this exercise is in service of</a><a name="ts_162070_168310_" > everyday suffering for people like me and you in a way to commit more fully to our embodied experience.</a><a name="ts_168310_176950_" > So the running and the evasion can all stop right here. I love that. And a friend introduced me to this</a><a name="ts_176950_185050_" > exercise. And when I did it, I was reminded that we can talk about feeling our feelings all day. But this</a><a name="ts_185050_189610_" > exercise, we&#x27;re actually just doing it. We&#x27;re just simply practicing it. And I found it really</a><a name="ts_189610_194530_" > valuable, really helpful for me. So I was, I was so grateful you were willing to share it with my</a><a name="ts_194530_199880_" > audience. Amazing. Yeah, I&#x27;m happy to do it. Do you want me to jump in? Yeah, let&#x27;s go. Let&#x27;s jump right in.</a><a name="ts_200220_205300_" > Amazing. I&#x27;ll ring some bells because they sound beautiful. And it also helps us kind of settle in and</a><a name="ts_205300_212704_" > really come to presence for this time. And we&#x27;ll just go, we&#x27;ll see five or 10 minutes. Great. Sounds great.</a><a name="ts_212704_236288_" > (24 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_236288_242850_" > So take these first few moments to settle into a posture that will allow you to be relaxed,</a><a name="ts_243390_254890_" > comfortable, but also very present and alert. I feel natural to take a couple of big breaths.</a><a name="ts_254910_262304_" > I really like to take an audible sigh and audible out breath. Just help me relax and let go. Yeah,</a><a name="ts_262304_263552_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_263552_272640_" > whatever works for you. And this is also a really good moment and important moment to ask yourself if it</a><a name="ts_272640_281790_" > feels safe to really move deeply into sensation. Uh, for many of us, at least some of the time,</a><a name="ts_282010_287870_" > it&#x27;s not the best moment to go deep into the body. So we shouldn&#x27;t assume that an experience like this,</a><a name="ts_287970_292310_" > a practice like this is always the right thing to do at any given time. You want to check in with the</a><a name="ts_292310_298050_" > body and get permission from yourself. Like, yeah, I feel resourced enough. I feel grounded enough to</a><a name="ts_298050_314050_" > go deep into my embodied experience. And if you do feel resourced, and if you do feel a little bit</a><a name="ts_314050_322070_" > adventurous, I&#x27;ll invite you to really just join your awareness right now with physical sensation.</a><a name="ts_322070_323168_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_323168_331990_" > Notice what&#x27;s present. We&#x27;re working in this exercise with everyday disturbance,</a><a name="ts_331990_333312_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_333312_336820_" > hundreds of times a day, maybe thousands of times a day. Things are happening</a><a name="ts_337580_343100_" > at a pre-conscious and unconscious level where we just feel a little ruffled, a little disturbed,</a><a name="ts_343968_350680_" > a little stirred up. And those moments go undetected. And we don&#x27;t realize that we choreograph</a><a name="ts_350680_360550_" > our lives around avoiding our embodied experience. So when you come into the body right now,</a><a name="ts_360790_365990_" > oh, happy day, you might notice that there&#x27;s already disturbance there, in which case you don&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_365990_372430_" > need to go looking for it. You don&#x27;t need to produce it. But if you&#x27;re feeling like quite tranquil and</a><a name="ts_372430_376870_" > calm, I&#x27;m going to ask you to stir that up a little bit just for the purposes of this exercise, to</a><a name="ts_376870_385500_" > call to your attention a moment today or a moment this week where you had a kind of troubling encounter.</a><a name="ts_386000_391920_" > It could be with life itself. It could just be inclement weather. But the deepest disturbance are</a><a name="ts_391920_399840_" > often related to other human beings&#x27; relationship. So the basic possibilities is when you bring your</a><a name="ts_399840_404900_" > attention to the body, you already feel disturbance here. But if you don&#x27;t feel any disturbance,</a><a name="ts_404900_411140_" > you can actually use this exercise to call up some disturbance. Maybe the image of a person that</a><a name="ts_411140_416640_" > you&#x27;re struggling with in a relationship right now. Maybe an interaction that didn&#x27;t go very well</a><a name="ts_416640_422660_" > and it&#x27;s kind of stuck in your system. It just doesn&#x27;t feel very good. And this is normally the exact</a><a name="ts_422660_429680_" > kind of experience sensation that we avoid. We try to shove it down. We repress it. We distract ourselves.</a><a name="ts_430580_436220_" > And we&#x27;re doing something counter-instinctual here by going right into it, going right into the heart</a><a name="ts_436220_449270_" > of the sensation. You call up a disturbing encounter, something someone said to you, something they did,</a><a name="ts_449530_467850_" > something that happened in life that left you feeling unsteady, unmoored, anxious, disturbed. As you</a><a name="ts_467850_472570_" > continue to breathe, you can notice where this shows up in the body. Where is the disturbance? Where is the</a><a name="ts_472570_478530_" > intense sensation that you would prefer not to be feeling, but nevertheless, it&#x27;s present in your</a><a name="ts_478530_492190_" > system? Rather than running, evading, distracting, repressing, can you just relax into it? Letting</a><a name="ts_492190_503350_" > awareness soak into the sensation like water soaking through a sponge. Really feeling what&#x27;s here to be</a><a name="ts_503350_518360_" > felt. Key to doing this is to let go of any interpretations. Because oftentimes with disturbance,</a><a name="ts_518360_523640_" > we get a story going, how dare that person? That should have never happened. Had that person</a><a name="ts_523640_528770_" > been doing what they were supposed to be doing, I wouldn&#x27;t be feeling like this. But in fact,</a><a name="ts_528770_535550_" > we are feeling like this right now. So it&#x27;s an opportunity to actually really commit to our</a><a name="ts_535550_544450_" > embodied experience. Letting go of the story. Even something as simple as an emotional interpretation.</a><a name="ts_544450_546464_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_546464_555930_" > Letting go of even emotion and going right to the raw sensation. And if it helps, you can</a><a name="ts_555930_563970_" > use a word or two to describe whatever physical sensation you&#x27;re aware of in the body. For me,</a><a name="ts_564210_574270_" > with my disturbance in this moment, I&#x27;m aware of clenching, a contraction in the throat, pressure.</a><a name="ts_574270_577376_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_577376_586272_" > I feel some ache in my heart. So see if you can do that. Just physical sensation, no emotion, no story.</a><a name="ts_586272_602848_" > (17 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_602848_609210_" > And it&#x27;s important when we do this exercise to ask ourselves, is the signal I&#x27;m getting from my body</a><a name="ts_609210_617190_" > indicating real danger? In this moment, there might actually be something unsafe. And you want to ask</a><a name="ts_617190_622890_" > yourself that. Is this signal from the body, this intensity, this disturbance, is it signaling that</a><a name="ts_622890_630610_" > something about the environment is unsafe? And if it is, we want to take care of ourselves and change our</a><a name="ts_630610_640350_" > circumstances as best we can. But if it&#x27;s a disturbance that&#x27;s not indicative of any immediate danger,</a><a name="ts_640350_651456_" > if we actually feel safe, that is, on an objective level, we can use this opportunity to go even deeper.</a><a name="ts_651456_664640_" > (13 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_664640_672256_" > Really finding our awareness on the inside of this intense sensation. Not trying to understand it. Not</a><a name="ts_672832_680768_" > trying to heal it. Not trying to liberate it. We&#x27;re not performing any operation on it at all. We&#x27;re just</a><a name="ts_681312_691456_" > training ourselves to stay embodied. Commit to the truth of our embodied experience right now. Stay</a><a name="ts_691456_715872_" > (24 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_715872_732060_" > with it. When you feel like you&#x27;re really resting in this disturbance in a way that we do not normally do</a><a name="ts_732060_740450_" > day to day, unless we bring some intention to a practice like this, you have the option of saying to</a><a name="ts_740450_754450_" > yourself, saying out loud, I commit to feeling this way on and off for the rest of my life. Commit to feeling</a><a name="ts_754450_770850_" > this way on and off for the rest of my life. Sometimes when we make this declaration, we feel</a><a name="ts_770850_778432_" > despair. Like, oh no. I thought one day I would finally be free of sensations like this. I would</a><a name="ts_778432_780928_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_780928_789230_" > finally be delivered from the suffering of my life. And if you feel despair, let that be a signal that you</a><a name="ts_789230_800060_" > can let go of any fantasy that one day as a feeling human being you&#x27;ll stop feeling and accept this</a><a name="ts_800060_809090_" > embodied reality that sometimes life hurts, sometimes it brings us joy, and that these are</a><a name="ts_809090_824700_" > passing ephemeral energies. On the other hand, sometimes we make this declaration that I</a><a name="ts_824700_830240_" > commit to feeling this way on and off the rest of our lives, and a light bulb goes on. We realize</a><a name="ts_830240_838370_" > that a deeper part of us is completely resourced to feel these sensations, all sensations, as they come</a><a name="ts_838370_846090_" > and go no matter what. We get an insight into the part of our identity that is bigger than all experience,</a><a name="ts_846090_852370_" > all feelings, all feelings. And we realize that no matter what life throws at us, we can remain</a><a name="ts_852370_861910_" > radically embodied, committed to the truth of this experience. And so if that&#x27;s your response</a><a name="ts_861910_867328_" > to this practice, just notice that, the freedom that comes with committing to this experience.</a><a name="ts_867328_869280_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_869280_874752_" > Either way, it&#x27;s good. The despair is good. The freedom is good. Whatever we feel, it&#x27;s information for us.</a><a name="ts_874752_895744_" > (21 seconds pause)</a><a name="ts_895744_904610_" > Let this sensation run its course, however long it takes. And at some point, as all sensations ebb and</a><a name="ts_904610_910630_" > flow, you&#x27;ll find yourself on the other side of intensity. And you&#x27;ll realize that you didn&#x27;t</a><a name="ts_910630_919850_" > abandon yourself. You committed to staying embodied. And now you&#x27;re free to act from a place where you&#x27;re</a><a name="ts_919850_927650_" > not avoiding yourself, not avoiding your embodied experience. You can be choiceful. You have agency</a><a name="ts_928210_937670_" > to decide, do I do something? Do I do nothing? What&#x27;s the next thing I can do? The most wise,</a><a name="ts_938330_984250_" > compassionate, and skillful thing I can do in response to life. If you found anything in this</a><a name="ts_984250_989090_" > video helpful, I would really appreciate it if you could give it a thumbs up or share it with someone</a><a name="ts_989090_990690_" > who could benefit from it today.</a></p></div></body>
