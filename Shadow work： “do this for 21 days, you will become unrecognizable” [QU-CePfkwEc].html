Clark back with another chart video, classes in session, so bust out the pen, bust out the journal, and we&#x27;re gonna dive deep on a deep concept, your shadow.</a><a name="ts_12090_17110_" > I wanna really simplify this at a fifth grade level for you. At least that&#x27;s my level of understanding.</a><a name="ts_17290_26190_" > I wanna explain briefly what your shadow is. We&#x27;ll look at Carl Jung&#x27;s model, why it actually matters practically in your life, but we&#x27;re not just gonna leave you hanging.</a><a name="ts_26190_36690_" > Alright, I got four banger questions we&#x27;re gonna spend a majority of the video on. These are four quick start shadow work questions that I think every single person should do in their life.</a><a name="ts_36870_42848_" > You do these for 30 minutes, and you&#x27;re gonna have way more self-awareness than 98% of people out there. You just will.</a><a name="ts_42848_44736_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_44736_53408_" > Let&#x27;s start with the easiest way to explain a complex subject. This basic oscillation chart. Green is good, red is bad.</a><a name="ts_54048_64180_" > So, in your life, you&#x27;ve probably noticed a pattern that you get some money, but then an unexpected bill comes up, and you&#x27;re net out to zero.</a><a name="ts_64300_71720_" > Or maybe you&#x27;re making a lot of progress with self-improvement, and then you find destructive habits come back, and it nets you out to zero.</a><a name="ts_71880_79480_" > Your relationship&#x27;s going really good, you know, you&#x27;re not fighting, and then boom, out of nowhere, there&#x27;s a fight that wipes out, like, three weeks of progress.</a><a name="ts_79480_83640_" > And this is why it feels life can sometimes be spinning your wheels in the mud.</a><a name="ts_83780_87920_" > And all self-improvement does is it focuses on these greens.</a><a name="ts_87940_91940_" > But rarely do we ever talk about some of the reds.</a><a name="ts_92120_94100_" > And do you see how crazy this is?</a><a name="ts_94180_98420_" > Because what you&#x27;re not doing is as important as what you&#x27;re doing.</a><a name="ts_98700_101960_" > Self-improvement, and I call this one self-acceptance.</a><a name="ts_102760_104580_" > This is where shadow work comes in.</a><a name="ts_104580_115820_" > It&#x27;s looking at the parts of you that are suppressed or repressed, or we don&#x27;t want to focus on it because it&#x27;s not as sexy as, like, writing the goals and saying you&#x27;re going to be a millionaire in the mirror 20 times.</a><a name="ts_116000_118000_" > But, man, this is important.</a><a name="ts_118120_120340_" > So, that&#x27;s why we do shadow work.</a><a name="ts_120460_121568_" > Does that make sense so far?</a><a name="ts_122176_121568_" > Cool.</a><a name="ts_121568_122750_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_122750_125600_" > Moving on to what is it?</a><a name="ts_125600_128032_" > (..)</a><a name="ts_128032_131360_" > The best way I can describe this is with Carl Jung&#x27;s model.</a><a name="ts_131360_138480_" > Some people pronounce it Jung, but then I just want to say Young Carl, and that sounds like a SoundCloud rapper that went to your high school who&#x27;s from Ohio.</a><a name="ts_138680_142900_" > Carl Jung studied under Sigmund Freud, who&#x27;s, like, the OG of psychology.</a><a name="ts_143120_145500_" > His model is that you are in the middle here.</a><a name="ts_145580_148220_" > You have a core self, an essence that is you.</a><a name="ts_148280_153860_" > But we have an outer projection and an inner world that we all operate with.</a><a name="ts_154180_157340_" > Your outer projection is what is known as your ego.</a><a name="ts_157640_159700_" > At the extreme, this is a persona.</a><a name="ts_159700_164400_" > You know, you change your opinions when you&#x27;re in a group of people so that you&#x27;re accepted.</a><a name="ts_164780_167140_" > Or we have a persona with Instagram.</a><a name="ts_167560_172320_" > You ever looked at your old feed that you archived and you&#x27;re like, I am embarrassed of it.</a><a name="ts_172400_174320_" > Like, I can&#x27;t believe I thought that was cool.</a><a name="ts_174520_179120_" > That&#x27;s because it&#x27;s cringe looking at your persona when you see it&#x27;s not really you.</a><a name="ts_179220_181260_" > It&#x27;s just the image you&#x27;re projecting out to others.</a><a name="ts_181480_189020_" > We think that that&#x27;s the marketable version of us because what&#x27;s on the inside, our secrets or our addictions or our dirty habits,</a><a name="ts_189020_192460_" > it&#x27;s like that, that&#x27;s unlovable and that right there is shame.</a><a name="ts_192620_196740_" > But then your inner world is where the shadow is.</a><a name="ts_196920_200220_" > And this is what oftentimes is unconscious.</a><a name="ts_200680_201940_" > There&#x27;s your subconscious.</a><a name="ts_202240_203300_" > There&#x27;s your unconscious.</a><a name="ts_203600_205360_" > There&#x27;s the collective unconscious.</a><a name="ts_205360_209000_" > All of us as a society who has a hive mind.</a><a name="ts_209240_222380_" > There are studies where monkeys on one side of the world learn how to use a tool and then monkeys on the other side of the world who had no contact with them end up within a week learning how to use that same tool.</a><a name="ts_222380_231520_" > That&#x27;s a collective unconscious that all of us are plugged into something bigger, at least what you believe and I believe as well.</a><a name="ts_231620_240860_" > Even this topic of shadow and us, my generation, millennials, being very self-aware, this is a collective wavelength that we&#x27;re all on.</a><a name="ts_241140_244160_" > So in sum, you have a core of who you are.</a><a name="ts_244704_250752_" > Your outer projection of who you want to appear as is your ego, your persona.</a><a name="ts_251328_256240_" > But inside, deep down, trapped within, your inner world is your shadow.</a><a name="ts_256260_261960_" > And this is what&#x27;s creating the dissonance between who I&#x27;m projecting and who I really am.</a><a name="ts_262080_272760_" > And man, that causes a lot of tension in the psyche that contributes to these low moments and the bad behaviors, quote unquote, of why we do what we do.</a><a name="ts_272960_273840_" > Does that all make sense?</a><a name="ts_273840_276460_" > Now, the third part of this video, the questions.</a><a name="ts_276560_289560_" > I&#x27;m super grateful I went through years of coaching and therapy, but man, the self-awareness is unmatched when you just really make the time to sit with yourself and ask the right questions.</a><a name="ts_289620_296540_" > So I&#x27;ll give you four and I just put out a free guide with my seven favorite shadow work questions.</a><a name="ts_296540_302880_" > So if you want these four and an additional three more, I&#x27;ll link down below where you can get that for free after this video.</a><a name="ts_302880_305600_" > (...)</a><a name="ts_305600_312800_" > Starting with number one, what do I need to finally let go of?</a><a name="ts_313344_324510_" > What events do you constantly ruminate on or replay time and time again in your mind and find yourself going back to that still feel charged is what we&#x27;re talking about here.</a><a name="ts_324510_327210_" > And I&#x27;ll give you a personal example.</a><a name="ts_327450_331590_" > I was in high school and I was madly in love with this girl.</a><a name="ts_331730_336390_" > And then one day out of nowhere, she left to get back with her ex.</a><a name="ts_336510_338430_" > It crushed me into a million pieces.</a><a name="ts_338750_349344_" > I created this big soap opera drama in my mind about getting her back or one day she&#x27;ll see what she was missing if I&#x27;m successful.</a><a name="ts_349888_354710_" > And success at a high school age for me was linked to attention.</a><a name="ts_355520_356000_" > That&#x27;s it.</a><a name="ts_356220_365980_" > I&#x27;m like, if I can just be seen, then I know she has to be thinking about me because, you know, if I&#x27;m acting up in class and getting in trouble, well, at least all eyes are on Clark.</a><a name="ts_366120_371040_" > I stayed in the self-pity loop, feeling like a victim for years.</a><a name="ts_371120_373040_" > I never talked to her.</a><a name="ts_373240_376520_" > I was just like, one day she&#x27;s going to realize what she was missing.</a><a name="ts_376780_383220_" > And I just, you know, I&#x27;d walk past her and, you know, feel like the self-righteousness come up like, okay, here&#x27;s my big moment.</a><a name="ts_383700_384820_" > You know what happened?</a><a name="ts_384820_385920_" > Nothing.</a><a name="ts_386560_388180_" > Nothing f***ing happened.</a><a name="ts_388420_395880_" > After years of staying in that mindset, creating this drama in my mind, we never talked since that one conversation at 16 years old.</a><a name="ts_396020_401960_" > I came to the realization, couldn&#x27;t let anyone in if I was holding on to this person.</a><a name="ts_401960_409400_" > That this story of being wronged or being rejected or, you know, trying to get attention, that was the thing that held me back.</a><a name="ts_409520_412320_" > And right there, I made the decision to let it go.</a><a name="ts_412500_413440_" > I gotta move on.</a><a name="ts_413540_415040_" > I&#x27;m done being this victim.</a><a name="ts_415160_416300_" > I&#x27;m done with this story.</a><a name="ts_416660_420690_" > And even if it&#x27;s true, do I want to be right or do I want to be happy?</a><a name="ts_420750_422530_" > And I know that story&#x27;s not unique to me.</a><a name="ts_422650_424570_" > I&#x27;m sharing that because that is very common.</a><a name="ts_424570_431790_" > Guy gets his heart broken by some girl and, you know, dedicates his whole life to proving something to them.</a><a name="ts_432070_435670_" > But 99 times out of 100, they never even see it.</a><a name="ts_435730_436410_" > They don&#x27;t even care.</a><a name="ts_436530_437050_" > They&#x27;ve forgotten.</a><a name="ts_437050_437890_" > They&#x27;ve moved on.</a><a name="ts_437890_440230_" > So you&#x27;re just doing it to yourself.</a><a name="ts_441056_450688_" > The Buddha says that holding on to resentment is like drinking rat poison and expecting the other person to die.</a><a name="ts_451648_453250_" > How hard does that quote hit?</a><a name="ts_453350_455910_" > I think relationships are a great place to start.</a><a name="ts_456090_460992_" > Like, what are you holding on to or who are you holding on to that you need to fully let go of?</a><a name="ts_461568_471744_" > Because even if it was when you were a kid, like, I&#x27;ve thought about this a lot, how relationships, no matter what age, emotions still feel the same.</a><a name="ts_472416_480130_" > Like, you being in love at 11 years old is still the euphoric feeling of love as when you&#x27;re 21 or 31 years old.</a><a name="ts_480130_484430_" > But you can&#x27;t rationally process it through because you just don&#x27;t have enough life experience.</a><a name="ts_484470_486890_" > But you&#x27;re still feeling the same emotion.</a><a name="ts_487210_488490_" > That emotion never changes.</a><a name="ts_488850_490430_" > Anger is still anger at 11.</a><a name="ts_490790_492590_" > You know, pride is still pride at 11.</a><a name="ts_492590_493970_" > Fear is still fear at 11.</a><a name="ts_494150_500970_" > You consciously develop more life experience and you can put things into perspective as you&#x27;re older, but you still feel the same emotions.</a><a name="ts_500990_507450_" > So that&#x27;s why childhood in therapy, people keep going back to because those emotions are real, man.</a><a name="ts_507790_512250_" > Like, you get trapped in those and that creates this little snapshot of what happened.</a><a name="ts_512250_516310_" > And now you store it and every decision you have, you link back to this one.</a><a name="ts_516530_517410_" > Relationships are great.</a><a name="ts_517610_518450_" > Any area is great.</a><a name="ts_518690_522470_" > What do you need to finally let go of is question number one.</a><a name="ts_522590_524890_" > I apologize for the chicken scratch handwriting, guys.</a><a name="ts_525070_526210_" > I&#x27;ll translate for you.</a><a name="ts_526570_528310_" > When did I experience rejection?</a><a name="ts_528650_532430_" > How can I show that part of me love or acceptance?</a><a name="ts_532850_537330_" > I understand hearing some of these if you haven&#x27;t done a lot of inner work or shadow work.</a><a name="ts_537330_544990_" > You might be tempted to write it off as, like, fluffy, like, oh, I&#x27;m just gonna love and accept myself, you know, that&#x27;s nice.</a><a name="ts_545050_546336_" > It is anything but easy, okay?</a><a name="ts_546912_548390_" > It is not light and fluffy.</a><a name="ts_548570_558850_" > Like, peering down to the depths of your soul, the shadow, the repressed, suppressed parts of yourself and trying to give it the things it needed, that is tough work.</a><a name="ts_558850_559490_" > Rejection.</a><a name="ts_559690_559950_" > Rejection.</a><a name="ts_559950_562230_" > This can show up in dating, like the example I gave you.</a><a name="ts_562390_566210_" > That is a rejection wound right there that&#x27;s also something you need to let go of.</a><a name="ts_566930_567370_" > Rejected.</a><a name="ts_567430_569070_" > You can feel rejected by your parents.</a><a name="ts_569350_572470_" > You can feel rejected at a macro level by society.</a><a name="ts_572730_575570_" > One that&#x27;s personal to me is toxic masculinity.</a><a name="ts_575570_582950_" > You&#x27;re labeled for being a guy bad, that you&#x27;re to blame for every single person&#x27;s problems in the world.</a><a name="ts_583030_584270_" > Let&#x27;s just blame the men for it.</a><a name="ts_584370_605060_" > You being born is not toxic, and if you don&#x27;t acknowledge that it&#x27;s okay to be a man, I don&#x27;t have to repeat what bad behaviors other men do, but I&#x27;m not toxic for existing, then you&#x27;re gonna have this shadow side, this repressed part of you down that feels bad for being a guy.</a><a name="ts_605060_611000_" > Feeling rejected in school, you know, what do we call it when you do bad on a test?</a><a name="ts_611220_612896_" > We call it failing.</a><a name="ts_613472_615136_" > You literally fail.</a><a name="ts_615808_619690_" > How can you not internalize that and feel rejected like you are a failure?</a><a name="ts_619870_624070_" > I&#x27;m not saying here everyone needs to get a trophy, and we need to give out participation trophies.</a><a name="ts_624150_625390_" > That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m saying here.</a><a name="ts_625490_630730_" > But it&#x27;s about separating yourself, not suppressing the rejection.</a><a name="ts_631050_632530_" > Okay, this is very important.</a><a name="ts_632530_638370_" > Because you got rejected, because you failed, does not mean you&#x27;re a failure.</a><a name="ts_638750_642170_" > Because you&#x27;re a man, does not mean you&#x27;re toxic.</a><a name="ts_642410_643530_" > You see the difference there.</a><a name="ts_643650_645510_" > It&#x27;s nuanced, very important.</a><a name="ts_645610_646730_" > This making sense so far?</a><a name="ts_646730_651370_" > I know it&#x27;s heavy, but thanks for hanging in there, because man, this is important.</a><a name="ts_651550_653130_" > Alright, this next one is fun.</a><a name="ts_653310_654030_" > This is a fun one.</a><a name="ts_654110_654790_" > This is a bit lighter.</a><a name="ts_655290_655770_" > Projection.</a><a name="ts_656330_657590_" > Projection is the next one.</a><a name="ts_657590_661970_" > And I like these themes, because there&#x27;s so many different areas with shadow work.</a><a name="ts_662110_664384_" > I&#x27;m giving you the main ones that I would look at.</a><a name="ts_664928_670130_" > When we&#x27;re talking about projection, there is no better question than asking yourself,</a><a name="ts_670410_672010_" > how am I that?</a><a name="ts_672090_678720_" > How am I that thing that I see in other people that I can&#x27;t even look at without judging?</a><a name="ts_678720_679808_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_679808_681010_" > That&#x27;s what a projection is.</a><a name="ts_681170_685630_" > Is you&#x27;re basing what&#x27;s in front of you on what&#x27;s happened in the past.</a><a name="ts_685890_687650_" > You&#x27;re reasoning by analogy.</a><a name="ts_687650_690390_" > How is this person like that person?</a><a name="ts_690570_692250_" > Oh, I&#x27;ve seen this person before.</a><a name="ts_692430_693930_" > You hear people say stuff like that.</a><a name="ts_694090_694750_" > What do you mean?</a><a name="ts_695030_695990_" > We&#x27;re all different.</a><a name="ts_696110_697330_" > We all respond in different ways.</a><a name="ts_697450_698950_" > How have you seen this person before?</a><a name="ts_699110_702750_" > On a deep level, I think this is why we&#x27;re drawn to the careers we&#x27;re drawn to.</a><a name="ts_702950_706290_" > I knew someone who had a family member that was a marriage family therapist.</a><a name="ts_706750_709490_" > And her marriage and family was a wreck.</a><a name="ts_709670_711170_" > It was disastrous.</a><a name="ts_711530_714470_" > It was like a WWE match in there every night trying to get dinner.</a><a name="ts_714650_715770_" > I was like, what is going on?</a><a name="ts_715870_716710_" > What&#x27;s this chaos?</a><a name="ts_716710_720640_" > At a macro level, the collective unconscious, drawing this in.</a><a name="ts_721216_723744_" > How am I that is cancel culture.</a><a name="ts_724320_725590_" > Oh, man, this is deep.</a><a name="ts_725670_726930_" > We could spend a whole video on this.</a><a name="ts_727150_731410_" > People are so drawn to exposed culture.</a><a name="ts_731670_737090_" > You ever see those videos on YouTube and they got like half a million, two million views, three million views?</a><a name="ts_737270_738530_" > Who&#x27;s getting exposed?</a><a name="ts_738830_740256_" > Who&#x27;s getting canceled?</a><a name="ts_740832_743720_" > All that is, is drama and gossip.</a><a name="ts_744100_749900_" > And it&#x27;s because, man, if we&#x27;re shining the light on them, I can project all the badness onto them.</a><a name="ts_750080_752520_" > Then it&#x27;s at least not on me.</a><a name="ts_752760_755240_" > And, you know, I can keep hiding in the closet.</a><a name="ts_755500_766140_" > And then what&#x27;s ironic, the people often leading with the pitchforks and torches to cancel people are the ones, five years later, getting canceled themselves for something similar.</a><a name="ts_766140_770540_" > Obvious reasons, I won&#x27;t throw examples out, but I&#x27;m sure you have some off top of mind.</a><a name="ts_770740_772080_" > That is a projection.</a><a name="ts_772380_775760_" > Asking yourself, how am I that, is a very humbling question.</a><a name="ts_775760_781180_" > Because anytime you point the finger, there&#x27;s three pointing back at you.</a><a name="ts_781360_783360_" > I see someone getting frustrated with their kids.</a><a name="ts_783620_785260_" > How have I gotten frustrated?</a><a name="ts_785540_790480_" > And I think about the other week where I got so mad when I was training my dog, I got really frustrated at him.</a><a name="ts_790640_792020_" > I&#x27;m like, I&#x27;ve been that guy.</a><a name="ts_792140_795960_" > This helps you develop an immense amount of compassion for other people.</a><a name="ts_795960_799960_" > And when you can develop compassion for other people, you&#x27;re more compassionate on yourself.</a><a name="ts_800420_801520_" > The last one.</a><a name="ts_801720_804672_" > The theme is feedback.</a><a name="ts_804672_806048_" > (.)</a><a name="ts_806048_806480_" > Feedback.</a><a name="ts_806480_810112_" > Now, before I spoil the question, I&#x27;ll give it to you at the end.</a><a name="ts_810784_812090_" > There&#x27;s a marketing principle.</a><a name="ts_812290_814976_" > This is something I learned in school.</a><a name="ts_815776_819230_" > Where companies use a ratio for complaints.</a><a name="ts_819550_826390_" > That if one person complains, they multiply it by, it could be a hundred, it could be a thousand, it varies.</a><a name="ts_826790_833430_" > They think that for every one person who voices this, there&#x27;s been a hundred or a thousand people who haven&#x27;t.</a><a name="ts_833590_836896_" > Now, how the heck does marketing relate to shadow work?</a><a name="ts_837632_843850_" > The saying is if you keep hearing the same thing over and over again, it might be true.</a><a name="ts_844150_848670_" > What&#x27;s a piece of feedback I&#x27;ve heard multiple times about myself?</a><a name="ts_849010_852370_" > You hear things, you hear feedback about yourself your whole life.</a><a name="ts_852670_855670_" > And whether you choose to listen to it or not, that&#x27;s on us.</a><a name="ts_855670_858830_" > So, I&#x27;ll give you a personal example to add some roots to this.</a><a name="ts_859230_864070_" > One piece of feedback I got time and time again is that I&#x27;m too critical.</a><a name="ts_864210_867850_" > I hold myself to an incredibly high standard.</a><a name="ts_868130_870330_" > You know, I have to do that for this business?</a><a name="ts_870450_872410_" > To believe in yourself enough?</a><a name="ts_872410_874350_" > To post videos on the internet for strength?</a><a name="ts_874350_878250_" > Like, it takes a lot of standards to uphold and grow a business.</a><a name="ts_878590_881930_" > The shadow side of having high standards is that nothing&#x27;s ever good enough.</a><a name="ts_882070_885370_" > But it can also carry over into interpersonal relationships.</a><a name="ts_885610_886890_" > You know, like with my girlfriend.</a><a name="ts_886890_889850_" > I have a tendency to be super critical on her.</a><a name="ts_889950_891450_" > And she doesn&#x27;t even deserve that.</a><a name="ts_891610_896970_" > It&#x27;s completely unfair for me to hold other people to the same standards I hold myself to.</a><a name="ts_897230_901070_" > And that&#x27;s a lesson I had to learn the hard way through getting feedback.</a><a name="ts_901070_902510_" > I hope you see the point.</a><a name="ts_902770_906290_" > What&#x27;s a piece of feedback you&#x27;ve heard about yourself multiple times?</a><a name="ts_906630_908170_" > Can it be true?</a><a name="ts_908370_911490_" > So, we went over to recap why shadow work matters.</a><a name="ts_911790_915110_" > It&#x27;s not always the highest levels that you rise to.</a><a name="ts_915250_918210_" > But you default to the lowest levels that you can accept.</a><a name="ts_918490_924950_" > And the way you get real progress is by looking at some of these unsexy parts of yourself.</a><a name="ts_925250_927930_" > That is what real self-growth and awareness is.</a><a name="ts_927930_935590_" > We also went over Yoon and his model, Carl Yoon, with the persona, the ego, the core you in the center.</a><a name="ts_935890_941370_" > And then the shadow side that holds us down in our inner world versus our outer world.</a><a name="ts_941530_948430_" > And I gave you the four questions with a category for each that I believe will unlock the next 2.0 you.</a><a name="ts_948910_951450_" > Letting go, rejection, projection, and feedback.</a><a name="ts_951450_957790_" > That is a great quick start guide to getting to know the shadow side and raising yourself up.</a><a name="ts_957930_959290_" > These are just four questions.</a><a name="ts_959290_962330_" > If you want all seven, I&#x27;ll link down below our free gift for you.</a><a name="ts_962450_963370_" > So, put it in your email.</a><a name="ts_963470_964530_" > It&#x27;ll get sent straight to you.</a><a name="ts_964630_965430_" > Thanks so much for watching.</a><a name="ts_965530_965790_" > Love ya.</a><a name="ts_965950_966690_" > See you in the next one.</a><a name="ts_966930_967670_" > Stop settling.</a><a name="ts_967850_968250_" > Start living.</a><a name="ts_968670_968930_" > See ya.</a></p></div></body>
