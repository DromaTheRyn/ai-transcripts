tiny.</a><a name="ts_121500_125200_S00" > Once they&#x27;re full, any extra glucose gets converted straight into body fat.</a><a name="ts_125360_128180_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C"

your bloodstream.</a><a name="ts_132120_133620_S00" > Simple carbs are tiny chains.</a><a name="ts_133800_135100_S00" > Your body digests instantly.</a><a name="ts_135280_136360_S00" > Fast blood

bacteria munch on it to keep your gut healthy and level up your poopy game.</a><a name="ts_152200_154400_S00" > Fiber also slows down glucose absorption.</a><a name="ts_154580_156200_S00" > Which helps prevent blood sugar spikes.</a><a name="ts_156420_157220_S00" > Now, fats.</a><a name="ts_157460_158760_S00" > Your brain is 60% fat.</a><a name="ts_158860_160240_S00" > Your cell membranes are made of fat.</a><a name="ts_160340_161480_S00" > Your hormones depend on fat.</a><a name="ts_161720_163280_S00" > So fat is definitely not an enemy.</a><a name="ts_163280_167760_S00" > And what makes a fat healthy or harmful is its molecular structure that determines how</a><a name="ts_167760_168800_S00" > your body uses it.</a><a name="ts_169040_173400_S00" > Saturated fats, like butter and coconut oil, are solid at room temperature and chemically</a><a name="ts_173400_173740_S00" > stable.</a><a name="ts_173900_175460_S00" > Which is why they tolerate heat well.</a><a name="ts_175600_176220_S00" > Good for cooking.</a><a name="ts_176320_177060_S00" > Fine in moderation.</a><a name="ts_177940_181100_S00" > Monounsaturated fats, like olive oil, are liquid but still stable.</a><a name="ts_181260_183620_S00" > The gold standard for everyday fats and heart health.</a><a name="ts_184160_186880_S00" > Polyunsaturated fats include omega-3s and omega-6s.</a><a name="ts_186980_189380_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:03:06]</span> Their multiple double bonds make them liquid and fragile.</a><a name="ts_189380_192640_S00" > So they oxidize easily under high heat or heavy processing.</a><a name="ts_192880_195080_S00" > And it&#x27;s the main reason seed oils are debated.</a><a name="ts_195240_196280_S00" > But your body needs both.</a><a name="ts_196460_198220_S00" > Omega-3 helps reduce inflammation.</a><a name="ts_198480_200840_S00" > Omega-6 helps create inflammation for healing.</a><a name="ts_201020_202240_S00" > It&#x27;s the ratio that matters.</a><a name="ts_202640_206600_S00" > Artificial trans fats, on the other hand, are harmful because of their unnatural structure.</a><a name="ts_206820_208720_S00" > They&#x27;re created by hydrogenating oils.</a><a name="ts_208720_212220_S00" > Which forces the fat into a rigid shape your body struggles to process.</a><a name="ts_212500_214500_S00" > And messes with your body in multiple ways.</a><a name="ts_214680_215400_S00" > Avoid completely.</a><a name="ts_215640_217020_S00" > And finally, fat isn&#x27;t the enemy.</a><a name="ts_217020_222200_S00" > It&#x27;s the transport system your body uses to absorb key nutrients like vitamins A, D, E, and K.</a><a name="ts_222360_222880_S00" > Now protein.</a><a name="ts_223080_224520_S00" > Its reputation speaks for itself.</a><a name="ts_224700_226500_S00" > Every cell in your body is made of protein.</a><a name="ts_226640_229940_S00" > But unlike carbs and fats, your body has no storage tank for it.</a><a name="ts_230020_230820_S00" > If you don&#x27;t eat enough.</a><a name="ts_230980_235220_S00" > Your body steals it from your muscles, hair, and nails just to keep your heart beating.</a><a name="ts_235360_238600_S00" > Protein is built from 20 Lego bricks, called amino acids.</a><a name="ts_238820_239640_S00" > 9 are essential.</a><a name="ts_239840_241200_S00" > Meaning, your body can&#x27;t make them.</a><a name="ts_241340_242660_S00" > The other 11 are non-essential.</a><a name="ts_242860_244400_S00" > Your body can manufacture them.</a><a name="ts_244400_245240_S00" > The trap is this.</a><a name="ts_245400_249940_S00" > If you are missing even one of the 9 essential amino acids, the entire construction project stops.</a><a name="ts_250260_256240_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:04:10]</span> That&#x27;s why animal protein, which is complete, is biologically easier for your body to use compared to many plant proteins.</a><a name="ts_256480_258080_S00" > This is where variety matters.</a><a name="ts_258320_263720_S00" > Like how legumes, such as peas, are typically low in methionine, while grains tend to be low in lysine.</a><a name="ts_263860_265380_S00" > So combining them fills those gaps.</a><a name="ts_265380_266800_S00" > Now for muscle building.</a><a name="ts_267080_270040_S00" > To flip on muscle protein synthesis, the body&#x27;s build switch.</a><a name="ts_270300_272880_S00" > You need a specific amino acid called leucine.</a><a name="ts_273040_275020_S00" > Muscle growth works like an on-off switch.</a><a name="ts_275260_278240_S00" > You only turn it on when you get enough leucine in a single meal.</a><a name="ts_278340_282080_S00" > For most people, that usually means getting around 30 grams of quality protein at once.</a><a name="ts_282300_285660_S00" > Smaller amounts throughout the day often aren&#x27;t enough to activate the switch.</a><a name="ts_285920_287920_S00" > Protein also has a higher thermic effect.</a><a name="ts_288040_292280_S00" > Your body spends more energy digesting it, which means you burn a few extra calories in the process.</a><a name="ts_292280_293640_S00" > Now, about quantity.</a><a name="ts_293960_296360_S00" > The RDA is basically the don&#x27;t die minimum.</a><a name="ts_296600_298160_S00" > The amount needed to prevent deficiency.</a><a name="ts_298440_300140_S00" > For different people, it looks more like this.</a><a name="ts_300140_301472_S00" > (.)</a><a name="ts_301472_303380_S00" > The food you eat doesn&#x27;t become energy instantly.</a><a name="ts_303580_306100_S00" > Carbs and fats enter your bloodstream as raw materials.</a><a name="ts_306340_308240_S00" > They have to be delivered into the mitochondria.</a><a name="ts_308360_309360_S00" > Yes, the powerhouse of the cell.</a><a name="ts_309500_313200_S00" > Inside the mitochondria, these raw materials are converted into ATP.</a><a name="ts_313540_317080_S00" > <span style="color: #78909C" >[00:05:13]</span> Think of it as the currency your body spends to move, think, and stay alive.</a><a name="ts_317320_320440_S00" > But mitochondria need micronutrients to act as cofactors.</a><a name="ts_320440_323080_S00" > So they can turn carbs and fats into usable energy.</a><a name="ts_323300_326340_S00" > Now, a healthy metabolism behaves like a hybrid engine.</a><a name="ts_326500_331860_S00" > It has two main fuel systems, glucose and fat, and it can switch between them depending on what&#x27;s available.</a><a name="ts_332080_332620_S00" > Sugar mode.</a><a name="ts_332880_334420_S00" > When you eat, blood sugar rises.</a><a name="ts_334780_338540_S00" > Because high sugar is damaging, your body prioritizes burning this first.</a><a name="ts_338940_339380_S00" > Fat mode.</a><a name="ts_339660_343740_S00" > Once the sugar&#x27;s gone, it flips the switch and starts burning stored body fat.</a><a name="ts_343900_347260_S00" > This is metabolic flexibility, and it&#x27;s a sign of a healthy engine.</a><a name="ts_347260_350400_S00" > If you snack all day, you constantly refill the glucose tank.</a><a name="ts_350460_353220_S00" > Your body never gets the chance to switch into fat burning mode.</a><a name="ts_353480_355520_S00" > And then there are the non-caloric nutrients.</a><a name="ts_355840_357260_S00" > They do not provide energy.</a><a name="ts_357440_357880_S00" > ATP.</a><a name="ts_358360_361380_S00" > You could eat 10 pounds of salt and drink 50 gallons of water.</a><a name="ts_361540_363980_S00" > And you would technically have consumed zero calories.</a><a name="ts_364360_365280_S00" > So why do we need them?</a><a name="ts_365400_367660_S00" > Because they basically ignite the energy to happen.</a><a name="ts_367960_369220_S00" > We divide these into two.</a><a name="ts_369500_369880_S00" > Water.</a><a name="ts_369980_370840_S00" > The
